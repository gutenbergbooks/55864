<h2>Dedication</h2>


<p>To few of us is it given to know where our
arrows come to earth or what shore is washed by
the ripples we create in the sea of life. But so
much is certain: somewhere our arrows <em>do</em> come
to earth, and somewhere the waves we set in
motion <em>do</em> wash the beach. And each arrow shot
from our bows and each wavelet we set in motion
is fraught with unseen possibilities for good or
evil. Whether we be man or child or growing
youth, we cannot escape the responsibilities entailed;
and, if we do with our might what our
hands find to do, our arrows and our ripples in
Time’s sea can cause only good.</p>

<p>In His wise providence the Almighty has so ordained
that the faith and enthusiasm of youth are
often more effective than the coldly reasoned acts
of maturity. If so be that many lads shall read this
and companion stories of the wireless and find
therein either pleasure or profit, they will owe their
gain to the fact that a youth who has passed to the
great beyond shot his arrow into the air with all
the courage and enthusiasm that a high soul and
a brave heart could command. To that youth,</p>

<p class="center largefont boldfont">Nelson Kimball Wilde</p>

<p>whose boyish enthusiasm for radio communication
first interested the writer in wireless
telegraphy, this book is affectionately dedicated.</p>

<p class="dropcap">To-day the American Merchant Marine
commands the respect of the world, for in
increasing numbers vessels flying the Stars and
Stripes are seen on every sea.</p>

<p>That our boys may know more about the many
experiences which such vessels encounter and to
tell the story of how Roy Mercer made good as
a wireless operator upon one of these vessels, is
the purpose of the author in penning this story

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE NEW WIRELESS MAN</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Roy Mercer sat by a window in a fast
express-train that was rushing across the
Newark meadows on the way to New York City.
Three years previously Roy had made a similar
trip. As he looked back now over those three
years, it seemed to him impossible that so much
could have happened in so short a time. When
he had first crossed these same meadows the country
was engaged in deadly warfare, and he had
come, with other members of the Camp Brady
Wireless Patrol, to help the government find the
secret wireless system by which German spies
were sending abroad information as to the movements
of American troops and American transports.
Long ago the wireless patrol had accomplished
its work and gone home. Now the great
World War was ended. And although peace
had not been formally declared, more than seven
months had already elapsed since the signing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the armistice that had brought an end to the terrible
conflict. In that period the nation had
swung back into its accustomed channels, and the
activities of peace had succeeded the feverish efforts
of war.</p>

<p>But the thing that had made the greatest difference
in Roy’s life was the death of his father.
Long ago the cherished hope of a college course
had disappeared, for upon Roy had devolved the
duty of caring, not only for himself, but also for
his mother. Manfully he had put aside his desire
and taken up the hard task that confronted him.
Through great determination and perseverance,
coupled with the devotion of his mother, Roy had
managed to complete his course at the Central
City High School. Now, at nineteen years of
age, he was about to make his way alone in the
world.</p>

<p>His active outdoor life, and the hard work he
had been compelled to do since the death of his
father, had developed Roy both physically and
mentally. Always alert, keen, and quick, in
these last few months he had developed unusual
qualities of self-reliance, trustworthiness, and
good judgment that promised well for his future
success. But Roy was fortunate enough to have
more than good qualities to start life with. Unlike
many boys who go to New York to seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
their fortunes, Roy already had a job. He was
going to be the wireless man on the steamship
<em>Lycoming</em>. The vessel was one of the new
steamers built by Uncle Sam during the war, and
was very shortly to make her maiden trip as a
coastwise liner between New York and Galveston.</p>

<p>As Roy sat musing over the events that had
led up to his present journey to America’s greatest
seaport, his train of thought was suddenly interrupted
by the loud voice of a brakeman.</p>

<p>“Manhattan Transfer!” shouted that individual.
“Change cars for lower New York.
This car goes to the Pennsylvania Station at
Thirty-third Street.”</p>

<p>The train came to a grinding stop. Immediately
there was great hustle and bustle. Passengers
poured out of the coaches and crossed
the narrow platform to the waiting cars on the
farther track. Others stood on the platform
ready to swarm into the newly arrived train.
Roy’s destination was lower Manhattan, but he
made no move to change cars. His orders did
not require him to report for duty until the next
day. He was in no hurry. He had come a day
ahead of time in order to familiarize himself with
his instruments and his new quarters, and make
the acquaintance of his future associates. Just
now he wanted to see something of the city. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he sat quietly in his seat, watching the hurrying
throng on the platform.</p>

<p>Presently there was a slight shock that jarred
the great steel coaches, and Roy knew that the
big steam locomotive that had hauled the train
from Central City had been replaced by an electric
locomotive that was to pull the train through
the tunnel under the Hudson River. A few
seconds later the conductor cried out his warning,
and the train glided smoothly away from the long
platform. Soon it was flying across the stretches
of meadow that lay between the junction point
they had just left and the landward side of the
Palisades, where it would plunge under ground.</p>

<p>The very last leg of Roy’s journey had begun.
The very last step in that long stairway of years
that led from the cradle to man’s estate was under
foot. For though Roy lacked two years of his
majority, he was henceforth to take a man’s place
among men. Roy thrilled at the thought that
inside of twenty-four hours he would no longer
be plain Roy Mercer, the Central City High
School lad, but Mr. Mercer of the Marconi service,
with his own quarters aboard a fine ship, a
place at the officers’ table, and a smart uniform.
Perhaps the idea of the uniform appealed to Roy
quite as much as did the knowledge that he was
about to take his place among the ship’s officers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
His heart beat fast, and his whole being thrilled
with pride at the thought that he was the youngest
operator in the Marconi service. Roy fairly
hugged himself as he thought of his good luck
in securing such a desirable berth.</p>

<p>Then the thought came to him that perhaps it
wasn’t all luck after all. Certainly, he thought,
he must have deserved at least a part of his good
fortune. There was nothing conceited about
Roy. But he knew, as no one else could know,
how hard he had worked to perfect himself in
wireless telegraphy, and how faithful he had been
in the performance of his duty as a member of the
wireless patrol. For it was the reputation that
he had made during the wireless patrol’s search
for the secret wireless that had won him his present
position as wireless man on the <em>Lycoming</em>.</p>

<p>Straightway he fell to musing over the events
of the years that had passed since his first summer
in camp at Fort Brady. Vividly he recalled how
he and Henry Harper had slowly and laboriously
constructed their first wireless outfits after some
blueprint patterns sent to Henry by the latter’s
uncle; how every member of the Camp Brady
group had made a similar instrument; how the
little band had become the wireless patrol when
war threatened, and how they had run down the
German dynamiters at Elk City. With pride he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
thought of his recent services in New York, when
he and three other members of the wireless patrol
had been selected to help the United States Secret
Service uncover the secret wireless of the Germans.
Roy was not the sort of boy to flatter
himself, but he knew well enough that never in
the world would he have been accepted in the
Marconi service at his age or been made wireless
man on the <em>Lycoming</em> had it not been for the
efficient work done in days past.</p>

<p>“It’s a mighty encouraging thing to know,”
said Roy to himself, “that my getting the job
wasn’t all kick. If I earned <em>this</em> place, I can
earn a still better one. But it means hard work.
It means that I’ve got to be absolutely faithful in
everything I do, always on the job, always on the
lookout to help the company, always courteous to
passengers, always helpful to my captain. Gee
whiz! It’s some job ahead of me. I can see
that all right. And I can see that above everything
else I’ve got to make good with my captain.
What he says about my work will determine
whether or not I ever get ahead. But I’ll make
good. I’ve just got to. I’ve done it before and
I can again. But it means work, work, work.”</p>

<p>Roy’s heart beat high with courage. His jaws
tightened and a look of determination came into
his face. Then succeeded a glow of pride as Roy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
thought of the times he had already been tried
and had made good. He smiled with satisfaction
as he recalled that it was he who caught the message
of the German spies at Elk City.</p>

<p>How well he recalled his vigil that night.
How long the hours were. How dark and still
it was there in the forest, with his comrades of the
wireless patrol all asleep and he alone left to
guard them and to keep watch for forbidden
radio messages. He recalled how sleepy he was,
how he had fought off his weariness and listened
in, hour after hour, for suspicious voices in the
air. Even now his heart beat faster as he lived
over the final triumph of that night. He could
almost hear again that faint little buzz in his ear
that proved to be the secret message they were
watching for.</p>

<p>Suppose he had been asleep at that instant.
Suppose he had been unfaithful in his watch.
Suppose he had relaxed his vigilance for even a
few seconds. The message would never have
been intercepted. The dynamiters would never
have been caught. The people of Elk City would
have paid for his faithlessness with their lives.
Roy shuddered at the thought of the awful wall
of water that might have overwhelmed the unfortunate
dwellers in that city had the reservoir
been dynamited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I wasn’t unfaithful,” muttered Roy to
himself. “I did my work right, just as I am
going to do it on board the <em>Lycoming</em>. And if I
do, I’ll win the good-will of Captain Lansford,
just as sure as I won that of Captain Hardy.”
Again a look of determination came into Roy’s
face. “I’ve just got to make good,” he muttered
to himself. “I’ve just got to. And I will.”</p>

<p>A subtle change came over his face. Once
more his mind had gone back to the scenes about
Elk City. He was thinking of his secret journey
in a motor-car through an isolated and rough
mountain road with the outfits of his companions.
Vividly he recalled how a big boulder had come
crashing down the mountainside, breaking his
steering gear. He smiled with satisfaction as he
recalled how he had met the situation by improvising
a wireless outfit with some wires, an umbrella,
and the battery of his car. How pleased
his captain had been!</p>

<p>“I’m going to please Captain Lansford just
as much,” said Roy to himself, and once more
that look of determination came into his face.</p>

<p>Then the train suddenly shot under ground
and daylight was blotted out. Down, down,
deep into the earth Roy could feel the train
descending, though the grade was very gradual.
His ears began to feel queer and he knew that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
must be in the deepest part of the tunnel. Then
the train moved upward. In another minute it
shot into the light. Roy glanced out of the window
at the high cement walls on either side.
They were at the Pennsylvania Station. Roy
rose and moved toward the door. His face was
flushed. His pulse beat fast. He felt like a
runner toeing the mark. He was about to begin
the race of life. He felt fit. He was trained to
the minute. His whole being pulsed with joy.
He had left boyhood behind. Henceforth he
would be a man among men. In every sense he
determined to be one. All aglow with high resolve,
he passed out of the train, through the great
station, and into the roaring streets.</p>

<p>The glow of satisfaction faded from his face.
Cold and hostile seemed the city. The rushing
traffic appeared cruel and heartless, threatening
to overwhelm even the vigilant. Passers-by were
as cold and unfriendly as the hard and echoing
stone pavements. They brushed by, seemingly
indifferent to any one or anything but themselves
and their own concerns. The very air was raw
and chilly. The entire atmosphere was oppressive.
It seemed to take the heart out of Roy.
It made him feel how tiny he was, how insignificant
in comparison with this great aggregation
of forces that men had brought together. Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Roy realized that this was the thing he had
to fight&mdash;this roaring thing called a city, where
every man’s hand would be against him, where
he could get ahead only by brute force, by overcoming
whatever obstacles rose in his way. Apparently
there was not a soul to help him. Success
or failure depended upon his own efforts.
The thought was bewildering, crushing, disheartening.
For an instant fear clutched his heart
and blanched his face.</p>

<p>And that was not because he was terrified by
the noise of the unaccustomed traffic, or confused
by the hurry and bustle. Those features of the
city’s life were as familiar to Roy as the city
itself was, for in the weeks he had spent in New
York during the search for the secret wireless, he
had become well acquainted with the geography
of the town. The difference was that then he
was with friends. Henry Harper and Lew
Heinsling and Willie Brown were with him, and
their beloved leader, Captain Hardy, was always
watching their movements to keep them out of
trouble and direct their efforts. Then Roy had
been among friends. Now he knew not where to
find a friendly face. For the first time in his life
he was realizing, as thousands of boys before him
have realized, the awful loneliness that can come
to one in a big city. The feeling almost overwhelmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
him. Gone were his plans to see something
of the city. A friendly face meant more
to him now than all the sights New York had
ever held.</p>

<p>“I’ll go straight to the <em>Lycoming</em>,” said Roy
to himself. “Even if I don’t know any of the
men on board, they will at least be friendly.”</p>

<p>He hurried over to Ninth Avenue and caught
a south-bound elevated railway train. In less
than half an hour he left the train and made his
way to the water-front. The vast expanse of
asphalt known as “the farm,” that borders the
Hudson for miles, was seething with traffic.
Skilfully Roy picked his way across the wide
thoroughfare, dodging trucks and drays, and
heading straight for the big piers of the Confederated
Steamship Lines.</p>

<p>The watchman at the entrance stopped him
and demanded to know his business. Roy explained.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said the watchman, but he looked at
Roy suspiciously.</p>

<p>Roy passed on into the great pier shed. At
one side of the pier lay the <em>Lycoming</em>. Nobody
paid the least attention to Roy. He made his
way aboard the vessel.</p>

<p>“What do you want here?” asked a sailor
gruffly, as he slouched on the gangway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want to see the captain,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“He’s busy. Come around later,” replied the
sailor.</p>

<p>“I’m the new wireless man,” explained Roy.</p>

<p>“I didn’t recognize you, sir,” said the sailor,
instantly straightening up and touching his cap.
“The captain is in his cabin. This way, sir.”
And he led Roy to an upper deck.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said a gruff voice, in answer to
Roy’s knock.</p>

<p>Roy pushed open the captain’s door and
stepped inside the cabin. “I’m the new wireless
man, Captain Lansford,” he said briefly. “My
name is Roy Mercer.”</p>

<p>The ship’s commander rose to his feet. He
was fully six feet tall and large of frame. His
hair was black, and heavy, bushy, black brows
almost hid his dark, piercing eyes. His nose was
large and hawk-like. So weather-beaten was his
skin that it seemed almost like leather. For a
moment he uttered not a word, as he looked Roy
over from head to foot. Then, in a tone of utter
disgust, he said, “You&mdash;a wireless man! Bah!
A wireless babe! I’ll see about this quick,” and
he stalked angrily from the cabin.</p>

<p>“Wireless man! Bah!” repeated the captain
as he hurried down the stairway. “Thirty years
I’ve sailed the seas and the only wireless I ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
saw was God’s lightning. Yet I never lost a man
or a ship. The owners have ordered it, and I
suppose I’ll have to put up with their newfangled
machines. But I’ll be hanged if I’ll have an infant
in arms to work ’em. That’s flat. I’ll tell
those Marconi people what’s what.” And he
bustled angrily off to the telephone in the office
at the shoreward end of the pier shed.</p>

<p>Meantime Roy stood in the captain’s cabin,
disheartened and disconsolate. No wonder he
felt downhearted. The man he must please had
taken a dislike to him at the very outset. He
did not know what to do, so he did nothing.
With a heart like lead he waited for the return
of Captain Lansford. Presently that irate individual
came storming back.</p>

<p>“Get up to the wireless house,” he said roughly.
“I’ve got to keep you for three months until a
new class is ready. But I don’t need any wireless
to run <em>my</em> ship by, so don’t you come bothering
me. Good-day, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good-day, sir,” echoed Roy, but the echo was
very faint indeed. Disconsolately he stepped
from the captain’s cabin, found his way to the
wireless house, and shut the door tight behind
him. For the moment his courage was almost
gone. Sick at heart, he sat down to think over
the situation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><span class="cheaderfont">THE SECRET OF SUCCESS</span></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“It’s the same old story,” muttered Roy to
himself, after a time. “I wonder if they
will ever stop saying ‘You’re only a boy.’ That’s
what they said at Camp Brady. Yet the wireless
patrol ran down the dynamiters when the
state police couldn’t find them. That’s what they
said here in New York when we were searching
for the secret wireless. Yet we found it, even if
we were boys. That’s what Captain Lansford
says now. Shall I ever be old enough to escape
it?”</p>

<p>Yet it was fortunate for Roy that he <em>was</em> but
nineteen. At nineteen one possesses the resiliency
of youth. One rebounds like a rubber ball. It
was so with Roy. A while longer he sat, his head
buried in his hands, his heart full of woe.
Hardly could he keep the tears back. Then the
buoyancy of youth asserted itself.</p>

<p>“Only a boy,” he said presently, straightening
up. “Isn’t there anybody in the world who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
knows that sometimes boys have brains and courage
and common sense? What was David but a
boy when he fought Goliath? What was General
Grant but a boy when he loaded the logs
alone? Who fought the Civil War but boys?
I don’t care if I am a boy. I can read and send
wireless messages with the best of them, and
there’s nothing conceited in my saying so, for
it’s a fact. Only a boy, eh? All right, I’ll show
them what a boy can do. Maybe that captain
can run his ship without the help of wireless, but
I’ll bet that after he’s had the wireless service
for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Roy broke off suddenly and his face became
very serious. “I almost forgot,” he said to himself
soberly, “that I have only three months to
serve on this ship. Just as soon as the next class
is graduated from the Marconi Institute, I’ll lose
my job.”</p>

<p>Roy’s face was very long indeed. “Maybe
I’ll never get another place,” he said. “If I
can’t make good on this ship, how can I ever get
a job on another boat?”</p>

<p>For a while Roy sat in deep thought. Then
a wan smile flitted across his face. “You’re doing
just what Captain Hardy warned you not to
do,” he muttered to himself. “You’re brooding
over trouble. If Captain Hardy were here, he’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
tell you to get busy and make good before you
lose your job. That’s what he would say. Well,
I don’t know just what to do, but I’ll make a beginning
anyway. And that’ll be to get into my
uniform.”</p>

<p>Roy jumped to his feet, opened his case, and
took out his shining new uniform. Rapidly he
put off his old suit and donned the new. A
mirror hung at one end of his room. In this Roy
surveyed himself with unqualified satisfaction.
The trim, blue uniform fitted him snugly, emphasizing
the fact that he possessed unusually broad,
square shoulders and a slim waist. He stood up
before the glass as straight as a young pine. Any
one with half an eye for physique could have told
that he was unusually powerful for a boy of his
age and that he gave promise of being a man of
great strength. His quick turns, as he surveyed
himself, first on one side and then on the other,
gave ample evidence of his agility. Could Captain
Lansford, who admired physical prowess
above almost every other quality, have seen Roy
now, he might have formed a more favorable
opinion of his new wireless man.</p>

<p>The Scriptures tell us that as a man thinketh
in his heart, so is he. The truth of that saying
was illustrated now in Roy’s case. The pride of
his new position and his new uniform filled his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
soul. Gone was the stoop in his shoulders. The
expression of gloom had disappeared from his
countenance. In its place appeared the old
look of cheerful confidence and determination.
Straightway Roy began to look about him.</p>

<p>The glow of satisfaction on his face deepened.
His little house, perched on the topmost deck
like an eagle’s aerie, was snug and comfortable
beyond anticipation. To Roy it seemed almost
palatial. The portion that was partitioned off
for his sleeping quarters contained his bunk, a
commodious closet, the fine mirror before which
he now stood, and all the other accommodations
that would be found in a first-class stateroom.
The woodwork was beautifully finished. Generous
coils of steam-pipes gave promise of abundant
warmth even when the fiercest winter storms
were blowing. Convenient electric fixtures were
provided for lighting. Altogether his quarters
were so snug and inviting that Roy momentarily
forgot his troubles.</p>

<p>When he had ended his survey of his little
sleeping room and stepped into the wireless room
proper, his heart fairly leaped with joy. On one
side of the little cabin was the operating table,
with its array of shining instruments. A leather-covered
couch stood along the opposite wall.
There was a small rack for signal and code books,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
stationery, etc., and a chair or two. But Roy
gave scant attention to the furnishings. He had
eyes only for the beautiful, glittering instruments
on the operating table. The wireless outfit was
complete. It included every necessary instrument,
and each was of the finest type, with the
latest improvements. Exultantly Roy fingered
one after another. Never had he dared hope to
have such an outfit as was now his. Of course
it was not literally his, but nevertheless Roy felt
all the joy of ownership. For three months, at
least, it would be his. No one else might touch
those shining instruments. Not even the captain,
Roy fondly believed, would dare to molest
them. Like Alexander Selkirk, Roy was monarch
of all he surveyed.</p>

<p>But the mere handling of his instruments
would never satisfy a boy like Roy. He sat down
at the table and eagerly clamped the receivers to
his ears. Skilfully he tuned his instrument, now
to this wave-length, now to that. Clear as bells
on a frosty morning came the voices in the air,
and Roy’s eyes sparkled as he listened in.</p>

<p>By this time he had forgotten all about his
rebuff by Captain Lansford. He was himself
again, alert, quick, curious as to all about him, intently
interested in every new phase of life. And
life aboard ship was distinctly new to Roy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
voices in the air he had listened to a thousand
times. To him they were an old story. But a
great, ocean-line steamship was still a delightful
mystery to Roy. He wanted to know more
about it.</p>

<p>Laying his receivers on the table, he sprang to
his feet, put on his new cap, with its gold braid
and its letters wrought in gold, and left the cozy
little wireless house. Hardly had he reached the
ladder when his eye was caught by the activities
on the pier. Though Roy had spent many weeks
in New York, he had had small opportunity to
see the shipping close at hand. So the scene on
the pier below was as novel to Roy as though he
had never been near a seaport.</p>

<p>Streaming in and out of the steamer’s hold
was a double line of stevedores, each pushing before
him a strong barrel truck. Those entering
were trundling great boxes or bales. Those
emerging pushed only their empty trucks.
Boxes, bales, packages and parcels of every conceivable
size and shape followed one another into
the hold in endless procession, while as endlessly
stevedores came empty-handed out of the ship.
The steady procession of freight handlers reminded
Roy of a double line of ants, some laden,
others with nothing to carry. Many a time Roy
had watched ants bearing spoils to their nests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Often he had marveled at their strength, as they
dragged along objects greater in size than themselves.
But never had he marveled at the ants
as he now wondered at these brawny stevedores.
Enormous boxes, twice or thrice their own bulk,
and weighing, Roy felt sure, several hundred
pounds apiece, they handled like so many bags of
feathers, trundling them swiftly over the uneven
plank flooring of the pier, shooting down the
gangplank with them, often to the apparent
imminent peril of their fellows. Yet never a collision
occurred, and never a crate was spilled or
upset.</p>

<p>When Roy grew tired of watching the freight
handlers, he turned away from the ship’s rail and
descended to the pier. For the first time in his
life he had a really good look at the inside of a
great pier shed. Jutting straight out from the
shore, the long, narrow pier, built on pilings and
tightly roofed over and walled in, extended an
unbelievable distance into the river. With quick
appreciation of its real length, Roy saw that one
could run a hundred yards straightaway on the
pier without covering half its length. In width
it might have been seventy-five to one hundred
feet. This great warehouse&mdash;for in effect it was
that&mdash;was piled high with mountainous heaps of
freight, and a seemingly endless procession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
drays and motor-trucks was constantly adding to
the store. From these huge piles the stevedores
were bringing the freight they were rushing into
the hold of the <em>Lycoming</em>.</p>

<p>It was a stirring sight to see the trucks constantly
arriving and departing, some piles of
freight growing bigger and bigger with every incoming
load, while others as constantly dwindled
in size. The former piles, Roy soon found, were
accumulating for other ships, while the decreasing
stacks had been brought on previous days for
the <em>Lycoming</em>.</p>

<p>Roy gained thus his first inkling of what was
meant by the term commerce. Never before had
he seen such huge stacks of goods assembled in
one place. It seemed to Roy as though all the
wares of all the merchants in Central City would
hardly make so great a pile if boxed and stacked
together. Yet all these materials were sufficient
only to fill two or three steamships of moderate
size. When Roy thought of the miles and miles
of piers along New York’s water-front, and
realized that each pier probably contained fully
as many manufactured products as the <em>Lycoming</em>’s
pier, it seemed beyond belief. Then he
thought of the labor necessary to handle all these
mountains of goods. On his own pier dozens of
men were at work. Motor-trucks and horse-drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
drays came and went ceaselessly, hour
after hour. It was awesome to think about.</p>

<p>“And this,” said Roy to himself, “is only one
of scores and scores of piers. And New York is
only one of America’s seaports. Then there are
all the railway stations and freight depots. My
goodness! Think how many hands it must take
to move all the stuff&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Roy stopped in sheer inability to comprehend
the vista of American industry he had opened for
himself.</p>

<p>“Well,” he muttered after a time, “I see one
thing. The whole country is united in a great
business. If any part of that business stops it
affects all the rest. Suppose all the boats along
this river couldn’t make their trips on time. The
piers would fill up so they would hold no more.
That would throw the truckmen out of work.
Shipments from the mills would have to stop.
Railroad crews would lose their jobs and the
mills would shut down. That would be an awful
calamity.”</p>

<p>The idea was so appalling that Roy paused to
ponder over it. “I see one thing clearly enough,”
he said to himself at last. “Everybody everywhere
has to do his part if the whole business is
to run right. Our job is to sail the <em>Lycoming</em>
safely and right on the minute. Maybe I won’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
be with her long, but as long as I am with her
I’m going to do my best to keep her safe and
right on the dot. That’s my job all right.”</p>

<p>It was. And if Roy had been a bit older, he
would have known that it was exactly the way to
make good with Captain Lansford in particular
and the world in general. Without realizing it,
Roy had set forth the fundamental rule of success&mdash;to
do with your might what your hands
find to do.</p>

<p>When Roy had tired of watching the toiling
stevedores, he strolled up the pier and out to the
street.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ROY’S FIRST FIRE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">So engrossed in the life about him was Roy
that for the moment he forgot all about his
troubles. On the street he encountered again the
multitudinous traffic that had so depressed him
upon his arrival in the city. But here it seemed
to go at a slower pace. There were more heavily
laden drays and fewer rushing motor-cars.
Somehow the atmosphere of the “farm,” with its
hard toiling drivers and signs of honest industry
seemed different from the cold and callous air
of Seventh Avenue and of Broadway. At any
rate, Roy felt different.</p>

<p>Probably that was because he had made the
plunge. Even if his captain was not what Roy
had hoped and expected, the ordeal of meeting
him was over. Furthermore, Roy was now on
his mettle. Unconsciously he was reacting from
the captain’s contemptuous attitude. Like any
lad of spirit, his pride was hurt and his sense of
justice outraged. His captain had condemned
him without trial. Roy was determined to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
that he merited his commander’s fullest confidence
rather than his contempt.</p>

<p>So now he walked along, holding himself
proudly erect in his new uniform, his head up,
his heart singing. In fact it could not have been
otherwise; for, trouble or no trouble, he had at
last reached the place every boy of spirits longs
for: he had a job. He had made a start in real
life.</p>

<p>The pier of the Confederated Steamship Lines
was not far from the foot of Manhattan Island.
Instinctively Roy turned his footsteps southward
toward the Battery, that little strip of green that
fronts the upper bay and that tips the end of the
island like the cap on a shoe. Often during the
search for the secret wireless, Roy had passed
through this tiny park on his way to the Staten
Island ferry, just to one side. But he had never
really had time to look about. He decided that
now he would explore a bit. Like any other
wide-awake lad, Roy wanted to see and know all
that he possibly could.</p>

<p>“I’ll look about the lower end of the island,”
said Roy to himself. “Maybe I’ll find something
of interest.”</p>

<p>Roy was right, but he had small notion of how
much he would find that was interesting. The
park was not unlike a half moon in shape. Paved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
walks, lined with benches, led hither and thither
between the stretches of greensward, and trees
and bushes beautified and shaded the grounds.
A lively breeze was coming off the water, and
this was grateful, for the day was a hot one in
late June.</p>

<p>Roy made his way directly through the little
park to the water-front. A low sea-wall, built
of great blocks of granite, formed the very end
of the island. Along this sea-wall ran a wide
promenade of asphalt, with benches on the landward
side. The sweeping wind was churning the
bay into whitecaps, and these came slap! slap!
against the sea-wall, throwing showers of water
high into the air and drenching the promenade.
Even the benches on the landward side of the
broad walk were soaked by the driving spray.</p>

<p>But the thing that took Roy’s eye was the
harbor. Six miles away, as the crow flies, rose
the hills of Staten Island, where he and his fellows
had watched so long for the German spies.
Far to the right were the low shores of New Jersey,
almost hidden in the smoke pall of the cities
there bordering the bay. In that direction, too,
loomed the Goddess of Liberty, symbol of all
that the word America means to the world&mdash;the
gigantic goddess whose high-held torch, flaming
through the midnight darkness, shows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
anxious mariner his way through the murky waters
of the harbor. To the left were the shores
of Brooklyn and the cliffs of Bay Ridge. While
near at hand and almost in front of the little park
lay Governor’s Island, with its antiquated stone
fort, its barracks, and all the other buildings
necessary in a military post. For Governor’s
Island is the army headquarters for the Department
of the East.</p>

<p>The miles of water, now tossing turbulently
and capped with white, were alive with shipping.
One of the great municipal ferry-boats, starting
for St. George, was tossing the spray to right and
left as she breasted the waves. Tugs, seemingly
without number, were puffing and bustling about,
mostly with great barges or lighters on either side
of them, like men carrying huge boxes under each
arm. Some of these barges were car floats, with
strings of freight-cars on their decks. Some were
huge, enclosed lighters, built like dry-goods
boxes, and towering so high in air as fairly to
hide the tugs that were propelling them. A
string of twenty barges, like a twenty-horse team,
with ten couples, two abreast and drawn by twin
tugs far ahead of them, was coming down the
Hudson. Heavily laden freighters of one sort
or another were riding deep in the swelling
waves. One or two sailing vessels, beating their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
way across the harbor, were heeling far over under
the sharp wind. A motor-boat was scooting
across the end of the island, and Roy even saw a
venturesome Battery boatman riding the waves
in a rowboat, at times standing out boldly on the
crest of a wave and again almost lost to sight in
the trough. But the sight that caught Roy’s eye
and thrilled his heart was an incoming ocean
liner, her high decks crowded with a multitude of
expectant folks. Many of those folks were men
who had come to New York, like himself, to seek
their fortunes. But they had come from far
across the seas. They were strangers in a strange
land. Roy wondered how they felt.</p>

<p>“If <em>those</em> fellows come here and succeed,”
smiled Roy to himself, as he watched the ship
ride majestically by, “I’d be a poor pill if I
couldn’t make good, wouldn’t I? Why, a lot of
them can’t speak English, and they’ve never even
been to school. I’ll make that captain of mine
take back what he said.”</p>

<p>Poor Roy! If he could have seen all the difficulties
ahead of him, he would not have smiled
so confidently. But he could not, and presently
he turned away from the harbor, still light-hearted,
to see what further things of interest he
could discover.</p>

<p>At that instant a bell clanged. Close at hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and directly on the water-front, Roy had noticed
a low structure with a little tower. But he had
been so engrossed with the stirring spectacle of
the harbor craft that he had paid scant attention
to the building or the narrow, low craft moored
to the pier in front of the building. He judged
that this bell, which was still striking sharply,
must be in this building. Curious to know what
the bell signified, Roy turned sharply about.
He was just in time to see a number of men in
dark blue uniforms rush from the building, race
across the narrow wharf, and leap into the little
boat. The hawsers were cast off and in a second’s
time the little craft was shooting swiftly
from her pier.</p>

<p>“I never saw anything like that before,” said
Roy to himself. “I wonder what that can be.”</p>

<p>He ran over to the little house, and on its front
were the words “Fire Department&mdash;City of New
York.”</p>

<p>“By George!” muttered Roy. “Those fellows
are firemen and that is one of those fire-boats I’ve
read about.”</p>

<p>He ran around to the seaward side of the building
and took a good look at the little steamer that
was plunging through the waves at a rapid rate.
She was long, low, narrow, and decked over in
the centre somewhat like a low lighter. She resembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a tug more than anything else, yet she
was unlike any tug Roy had ever seen. Fore
and aft and amidships, Roy saw long, glistening
brass nozzles permanently mounted on the superstructure
and he knew that the boat’s engines
would suck up the harbor water and shoot it
through these nozzles with terrific force.</p>

<p>How he wished he could be aboard of her.
How he would like to help fight the fire. He
wondered where it could be. The little boat was
heading straight for the Brooklyn shore. There
Roy saw smoke rolling upward in great clouds
from a pier shed. The distance was so great
that Roy could not see distinctly, but he was sure
that tugs were trying to pull a great steamship
from her berth beside the burning pier. Even as
he watched, flames burst from the shed. They
swept outward in great sheets as they were
fanned by the draughts within the shed. To Roy
it seemed as though the flames were fairly licking
the helpless liner.</p>

<p>“Will they get her away in time?” Roy asked
himself, and his heart almost stood still as he
watched the struggle. It seemed to him that the
great ship was moving, but he could not be sure.
Intently he watched. After a few minutes he
was certain that the distance between the pier
and the ship was growing greater. But it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
still so small that the flames blew about the boat
like clouds of fire, and Roy knew that blazing
embers must be fairly raining on the ship’s
decks.</p>

<p>So fascinated was he by the struggle that he
completely forgot the little fire-boat until suddenly
it shot into his field of vision. It steamed
directly between the endangered ship, from which
Roy could now see puffs of smoke arising, and
the blazing pier. In another instant Roy saw
great columns of water shoot from the fire-boat’s
nozzles and fall in drenching torrents on the helpless
liner. Gradually the tugs pushed the huge
craft farther and farther from the shore. The
fire-boat stood alongside and hurled thousands
of gallons of water over her, until the last vestige
of smoke disappeared from the big ship. Then
the fire-boat steamed close to the pier, which was
now a roaring bonfire, and played its streams
steadily into the flames.</p>

<p>Roy heaved a sigh of relief. “They saved
her,” he said to himself. “They saved her. But
suppose there had been no fire-boat. The land
engines couldn’t have helped her a bit. She’d
have burned to the water’s edge. That would
have been terrible.”</p>

<p>It came to Roy that a fire at sea was a million
times worse than a conflagration like the one he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was watching. “Those people over there,” he
muttered, as he looked at the rescued ship, “could
have gotten away even if the ship had burned.
The tugs would have taken them off. But if a
ship ever got afire on the ocean the people aboard
wouldn’t have one chance in a thousand.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a great light leaped into his eyes.
“Yes, they would,” he corrected himself. “And
that chance would be the wireless. It could bring
help to a ship at sea just as surely as that fire
gong brought the fire-boat.”</p>

<p>On his face came a look of deepest determination.
“If ever anything like that happens on
the <em>Lycoming</em>,” he muttered.</p>

<p>But the sentence went unfinished. Again the
gong in the fire-house clanged its warning. It
was another alarm. Hardly had it sounded before
a whistle shrieked long and sharply at the
western end of the Battery. Everywhere whistles
were tooting, as vessels exchanged signals with
one another in the crowded harbor; but this
whistle was so insistent, so unlike the tooting
signals all about him, that Roy turned to discover
what could have made it. He was just in
time to see a little steamer poke her nose out from
behind the pier at the western end of the promenade.
Sharply the craft turned eastward and
in another moment was speeding past Roy almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in the path the fire-boat had taken. The
boat was a small, shapely craft that looked more
like a private yacht than anything else. What
instantly caught Roy’s eye were the wireless
antennæ strung above the boat.</p>

<p>Roy’s eyes sparkled. “That’s the police boat
<em>Patrol</em>,” he thought. “She’s going to the fire.”
And his mind went back to the night when he and
his companions had raced up the East River on
that same little craft in their search for the secret
wireless.</p>

<p>For a long time Roy stood looking at the little
police boat as she fought her way through the
swirling current, but actually he saw nothing.
He was lost in thought. Then a passer-by caught
his attention. Scores of persons had gone by
while Roy was watching the fire, yet he had paid
no heed to any of them. But the instant his eye
rested on this man Roy felt attracted to him.</p>

<p>The stranger was somewhat stout and his face
was tanned a deep brown, as though he had been
exposed to wind and weather. He wore a well-fitting
suit of yachting flannels and a yachting
cap of blue was set rather rakishly on his head.
Roy instantly decided that the stranger must be
a seafaring man. But what attracted Roy to
the man was the latter’s jolly, friendly expression.
He fairly exuded good nature. Roy felt that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
would like to know the man. The stranger, however,
hardly noticed Roy, but walked rapidly
along the promenade, with a step that was wonderfully
light and quick for a man of his build.
Roy knew that it was impolite to stare at people,
but he was so drawn to this passer-by that he
couldn’t resist the temptation to turn around and
watch him. In another second he was glad he
had done so.</p>

<p>A great wave crashed against the sea-wall and
showered both Roy and the stranger with spray.
Roy was annoyed at getting his new uniform wet.
The stranger only laughed, though he was far
wetter than Roy. From a side pocket of his coat
he drew a white handkerchief and wiped the spray
from his face. With the handkerchief he pulled
out a letter. He did not notice it, and in a second
the wind whirled it away through the park.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” shouted Roy. “You lost a
letter.” And he dashed across the green after
the flying envelope. His voice was drowned in
the babel of sounds and the stranger went on his
way unheeding.</p>

<p>Roy pursued the elusive paper almost to
Broadway before he managed to clutch it. Then
he turned and dashed back across the park. The
stranger had disappeared, but Roy knew that he
could single the man out because of his white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
clothes. So he ran on down the promenade in
the direction the stranger had taken. But he
could find him nowhere. Roy reached the western
end of the promenade and looked up West
Street. The man was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t have gone much farther than
this,” reasoned Roy. “Probably he has gone
into some building. He might have gone into
the harbor police station. I’ll look there for
him.” And Roy turned toward the building on
the pier from beside which the <em>Patrol</em> had
emerged.</p>

<p>He pushed open the door and entered the Harbor
A Station. A lieutenant of police sat behind
a big desk and on the floor before him was
the man Roy was searching for. But the man’s
expression had changed greatly. He looked
troubled and worried.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Roy, stepping toward
the stranger, “but this letter belongs to
you. It came out of your pocket when you
pulled your handkerchief out and the wind blew
it away. I shouted at you to wait, but I suppose
you didn’t hear me. I had to chase it nearly to
Broadway and when I got back you had gone.
I’m glad I found you.”</p>

<p>“By George, youngster!” said the man, grasping
the letter eagerly. “You aren’t half as glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
as I am. That’s a mighty important letter. I
discovered when I replaced my handkerchief that
it was missing, and I stepped in here to report the
loss. I thought I had been robbed.”</p>

<p>He looked the letter over critically to make
sure it was all right. “You’ve done me a mighty
good turn, youngster,” he said. “What do I
owe you?”</p>

<p>Roy drew back, frowning. “Nothing, sir,”
he said. “I didn’t chase your letter for money.”</p>

<p>The man looked sharply at Roy. “Then what
did you do it for?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Roy was rather nonplused. “Why, why&mdash;there
wasn’t anything else to do,” he stammered.
“You lost your letter; nobody else saw you lose
it; and so there wasn’t anything else to do.”</p>

<p>The stranger laughed uproariously. Roy felt
almost hurt. His face must have betrayed the
fact, for suddenly the stranger checked his laugh.
“You’re a fine lad,” he said. “A fine lad. And
it’s plain as the Woolworth Building that you
don’t belong in this town.”</p>

<p>Roy was astonished. “I don’t,” he assented,
“but how did you know it?”</p>

<p>Again the man burst into laughter. “Listen
to that, Lieutenant,” he chuckled. “Listen to
that.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to Roy, he said, “Where do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
come from, lad? I see by your uniform that
you’re a wireless man.”</p>

<p>Roy glowed with pride. “My home is in
Pennsylvania,” he replied. “I’m the wireless
man on the Confederated liner <em>Lycoming</em>.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you are!” said the man. “The
deuce you are!” And his eyes fairly danced.
Then he added, with a chuckle, “Have you met
Captain Lansford yet?”</p>

<p>Roy’s sober expression was answer enough for
the stranger. He burst into another hearty
laugh. Then he said; “See here, lad. Don’t
you pay any attention to Captain Lansford. His
bark is worse than his bite. You do your duty
and you’ll make good with him.”</p>

<p>“Do you know him?” asked Roy incredulously.</p>

<p>“I should say I do,” rejoined the stranger.
“But I must be on my way. I’ve got a lot to
do.”</p>

<p>He thanked Roy again for his kindness and
turned away. But immediately he faced about.
“Know anybody in this town?” he asked, then
added with a chuckle, “that is, anybody but Captain
Lansford?”</p>

<p>“Hardly anybody,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said the stranger. “What
are you doing with yourself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought I might find something interesting
down here,” said Roy. “I want to see everything
I can while I have the opportunity.”</p>

<p>“Good boy,” said the stranger. “That’s the
way to get ahead. You’ve come to the right
place to see things, too. Why, lad, this is one of
the most interesting places in all America. Yes,
and in all the world&mdash;this neighborhood right
here. I could talk to you about it for hours, but
I haven’t time now. Go get yourself a guide-book
and go over the place thoroughly. You’ll
never be sorry. If you can’t find one, I’ll lend
you mine. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“But I may never see you again,” said Roy.</p>

<p>The man chuckled. “Oh! yes you will,” he
smiled. “I’m going to look you up on the <em>Lycoming</em>.
Good-bye.” He held out his hand,
grasped Roy’s so firmly that he made Roy wince,
and was off.</p>

<p>Roy watched him disappear in the crowd. He
felt as though a great weight had been lifted from
his shoulders. He was no longer alone in a big
city. He had a friend. At least, he believed the
man was going to be his friend, and he was
glad of it. But suddenly his face grew long
again.</p>

<p>“I forgot to get his name,” muttered Roy,
“and I could have had it without asking. All I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
needed to do was to read the address on the envelope.
Now I may never see him again.”</p>

<p>For a minute Roy felt gloomy enough. Then
he recalled the man’s promise to look him up on
the <em>Lycoming</em>. “If he does,” smiled Roy, “I’ll
bet a dollar I won’t forget again to find out his
name. Now I’m going to take his advice and get
a guide-book. Wonder where I can find one.”</p>

<p>A policeman was passing. Roy stopped him
and asked where he could purchase the desired
volume. The policeman directed him to a near-by
book shop and in a few minutes Roy was back
in Battery Park with a little guide-book in his
hand.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN LOWER NEW YORK</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“Now,” thought Roy, as he sought out a
shady bench and sat down, “if this book
will tell me, I’m going to find out why this park
is called Battery Park. I’ve often wondered.”</p>

<p>He opened his book and, turning to the index,
readily found where to look for the information.
Looking on the proper page, he read: “Battery
Park and Battery Place take their name from the
fortification begun in 1693 by Governor Fletcher
to defend the city. The original battery was a
line of cannons extending from the foot of Greenwich
Street to the intersection of Whitehall and
Water Streets.”</p>

<p>“That was a pretty nice row of cannons,”
thought Roy, glancing up from his book to see
about where these guns had stood. With the
geography of the city he was quite familiar, as it
had been necessary, during the search for the secret
wireless, for Roy and his companions to acquaint
themselves with the city in order that they
could travel surely and speedily. After he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
measured the distance with his eye, he turned
back to the guide-book and read: “The land beyond
this line was under water until after 1800.”</p>

<p>At first Roy did not grasp the significance of
the statement. But when he read that the original
shore-line of the lower end of Manhattan
Island is marked approximately by Greenwich,
State, and Pearl Streets, he was almost stunned.</p>

<p>“Why, gee whiz!” he muttered. “That
means that all this park, which the book says contains
twenty-one acres, and all the ground on
either side of the lower end of the island for two
or three blocks inland is made land. Just think
of that.” In amazement he stared about the little
park, then looked at the two broad blocks between
Greenwich Street and “the farm.”
“Made land,” he thought, “every inch of it.
Why, they must have made hundreds of acres. I
wonder where they got all the stuff to fill in with.
What a lot of work it must have been! And
what a pile of money it must have cost. But I
suppose it’s worth millions and millions of dollars
now.”</p>

<p>He picked up his guide-book again. “The
land under water,” he read, “was ceded to Congress
by the city for the erection of a fort to defend
the city. The fort, about three hundred
feet from shore, later called Castle Clinton, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
built on a mole and connected with the city by a
bridge. In 1822 it was ceded to the state; in
1823 it was leased to the city, and in 1824 it was
leased as an amusement hall, known as Castle
Garden. It was roofed over and was the scene
of Lafayette’s reception in 1824. In 1835 Samuel
F. B. Morse here first demonstrated the possibility
of controlling an electric current. Here
Jenny Lind sang in 1850, and in 1851 Kossuth
was received here. In 1855 it became the Immigration
Bureau. In 1891 Battery Park was filled
in, and in 1896 the building was opened as an
aquarium.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” smiled Roy happily. “I’ve
often heard of the aquarium. It contains one of
the most famous collections of fishes in the world.
But I never dreamed that it was such a famous
old place as that. I’m going to see that, sure.
It must be that queer, circular brownstone building
near the harbor police station.”</p>

<p>Roy’s guess proved to be correct, as the sign
above the entrance told him. But before entering
he walked completely around the structure.</p>

<p>“Makes you think of a stone bandbox,” said
Roy, with a chuckle. “It’s so much like that
funny building on Governor’s Island that they
look like twins. I’ll bet that was another fort.”</p>

<p>Roy was right again. His guide-book said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
that the old fort on Governor’s Island was known
as Castle William.</p>

<p>In walking around the aquarium Roy discovered
at intervals what looked like window spaces
that had been walled in. But he knew that they
must have been the embrasures for the thirty
heavy guns with which the fort was armed.</p>

<p>When he had completed the circuit of the
building, Roy went inside. In the centre of the
floor was a tiled tank, like the hub of a wheel,
while strung around the wall, like the tire of the
wheel, were tanks and tanks of fishes, so arranged
that the light shone through the tanks, perfectly
illuminating everything in them.</p>

<p>Roy went directly to the circular tank in the
centre. It contained a great sea-cow or manatee.
Often Roy had read of these curious creatures
and he knew at once what the thing was. It was
as big as a fat pig and had a broad oval tail, with
fore limbs in the form of flippers. The animal
reminded Roy of the performing seals he had
seen at a circus. He had read that at night the
manatee is said to come out of the water. He
wondered if it were true. He was particularly
interested in this fish for he knew that it lived in
the southern waters he would soon be sailing.
He hoped that he would see some of them in the
sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>In the tank with the manatee were some flounders.
Roy was amazed to note that they were
almost white, like the sand in the bottom of the
tank. He had often seen flounders, but never
any of that color. It puzzled him until he remembered
that the flounder, like many another
creature, possesses the power of protective coloring.
Roy wondered how it was possible for any
creature to change its color to match its environment.
But, like many a wiser person, he pondered
over the matter in vain.</p>

<p>When he had grown tired of watching the sea-cow
and the white flounders, he walked over to
the ring of tanks, and, beginning at one side of
the entrance, walked slowly around the building.
Never had Roy dreamed that there could be such
fishes as he now beheld. Not only did he find the
familiar fishes of our own waters that he had
caught or seen for sale in the markets, but also he
saw strange and curious creatures from every
part of the world. What astonished him most
was the vivid coloring of some of the fishes from
the tropics. Roy had often seen parrots and
other tropic birds, and he knew that the birds in
these hot regions were more brilliant in hue than
our own birds. But he had never dreamed that
the fishes would likewise be gaily colored. Yet
here he beheld fishes of red and green and blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and yellow, as brilliant in color as any parrot or
parrakeet he had ever seen.</p>

<p>When he had become tired of looking at fishes,
Roy left the aquarium and again sought a shady
seat. As he opened his book his glance rested on
the words “Fort Amsterdam.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how many forts those old fellows
had, anyway,” thought Roy. “I’ll just see what
it says about Fort Amsterdam,” and he began to
read: “Before the first great fire visited Manhattan
in 1626, the lines of a fort were laid out,
occupying the site of the present Custom House,
the work being completed between 1633 and
1635. Fort Amsterdam, as the work was called,
was built of earth and stone and had four bastions.
It rose proudly above the group of small
houses and became the distinctive feature of New
Amsterdam. The main gate of the fort opened
on the present Bowling Green, which from the
earliest days was maintained as an open space.
It was, in fact, the heart of the Dutch town. It
provided a playground for the children, a site for
the May-pole around which the youths and
maidens danced, a parade-ground for the soldiers,
and a place for the market and annual cattle
show. Here also were held those great meetings
with the Indians, at which treaties were arranged
and the pipe of peace was smoked. In 1732 it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
was leased to three citizens who lived close at
hand, for one peppercorn a year, as a private
bowling ground, from which fact it takes its
name.”</p>

<p>“Think of that,” mused Roy. “They used to
smoke the peace-pipe there. Now the place is
surrounded by sky-scrapers, trolley-cars run past
it, subway trains rumble underneath it, and elevated
trains thunder by within a few feet. I
wonder what those Indians would think if they
could ever come back to earth and see Manhattan
Island now.” Roy chuckled at the idea, but
when he thought of the Dutch cattle shows he
laughed outright. “Wouldn’t a herd of cattle
tethered in Bowling Green create a sensation
now?” he said to himself. “I must take a look
at that place.”</p>

<p>He jumped up and crossed the park, heading
for the Custom-house at the eastern end. This
was a huge building, some seven stories in height,
that covered an entire block. Roy walked around
it, pausing finally to admire the groups of beautiful
statuary that adorned the front of the building.
For a long time Roy gazed at the Custom-house,
and the longer he looked the more beautiful
he thought the building was.</p>

<p>He had often seen it on his previous visit, but
he had been so preoccupied then that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
given little thought to it or any other building.
Though he had learned well the geography of the
city, in order that he might get about with facility,
he had learned nothing of the history or
meaning of New York. Now that he was looking
at things from a new point of view, it seemed
as though he had never seen them before. It was
so with Bowling Green. Often he had passed
the little fenced-in oval of grass, with its few
benches and a tree or two, but it had been to him
only a tiny bit of green. It had held no meaning.
Now in fancy he saw the old fort with its little
parade-ground, its gates open, and the Dutch
soldiers marching out to drill. He pictured the
boys and girls frolicking about the May-pole.
And when he thought of the cattle shows, he
laughed again.</p>

<p>Roy went into the tiny oval and sat down on a
bench to think this all over. “It was almost
three hundred years ago,” he mused, “when they
built that old fort. That’s a long time. It’s so
long that I suppose there isn’t a thing left that
was standing in those days. That’s funny, too,
for I’ve read that in England there are buildings
hundreds and hundreds of years old. I wonder
what’s the oldest thing here.”</p>

<p>Roy looked about but could find nothing that
he thought seemed very old. “That’s the queer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
thing about New York,” was his comment.
“There never has been much in it that is old.
They keep tearing things down and building new
things in their places all the time. No wonder
they say that New York will never be finished.
There isn’t anything old here.”</p>

<p>But Roy was mistaken, and when he fell to
reading in his guide-book again he discovered it.
For the fence that surrounded the little oval was
almost a century and a half old. “This fence,”
Roy read, “was imported from England in 1771
to enclose a lead equestrian statue of George III.
On the posts were the royal insignia. In 1776,
during the Revolution, the lead statue was
dragged down and moulded into bullets by the
colonists, and the royal insignia were knocked
from the tops of the posts. The fractures can
still be seen.”</p>

<p>Roy jumped up and ran over to the fence.
Sure enough, each post showed plainly that its
top had been broken off. Roy was amazed.</p>

<p>“To think that this fence was standing at the
time of the Revolution,” he thought. “Why,
Washington must have been here often and he
probably looked at these broken posts just as I
have.”</p>

<p>Doubtless Washington did see the posts. Certainly
he must have been in the Bowling Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
many a time. Only a short distance from the
Bowling Green, in Fraunces Tavern, at Broad
and Pearl Streets, Washington said farewell to
forty-four of his officers at the close of the Revolution,
a fact that Roy soon discovered from his
guide-book. Immediately he hurried away to
take a look at this beautiful old building of colonial
design, made of yellow Dutch bricks. Roy
admired it very much. A bronze tablet on
the corner of the building stated that it was
now the property of the Sons of the Revolution.</p>

<p>“Good!” thought Roy. “Now I know of
two things in New York that haven’t been torn
down. And I don’t believe they ever will
be.”</p>

<p>When Roy looked further in his book he found
there were many, many old things remaining, so
many that he could not hope to see them in one
day, and particularly not on this day, for it was
already supper time. But there was one place
that Roy was eager to see. The guide-book said
that a tablet on the building at 41 Broadway
marked the site of the first houses or huts erected
on Manhattan Island by white men. They were
built about 1613.</p>

<p>“I’ll just walk up Broadway,” thought Roy,
“and see that tablet. Then I’ll go on up Broadway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
get something to eat, and go back to the
<em>Lycoming</em> after supper. I suppose I could get
a meal aboard the <em>Lycoming</em>, but likely I’d have
to eat with Captain Lansford.”</p>

<p>Roy walked slowly up the longest street in the
world; for Broadway, extending far beyond the
limits of New York City, and passing through
one community after another, is still Broadway
half a hundred miles from Bowling Green. He
could hardly have gone otherwise than slowly if
he had tried, for it was the evening rush hour.
From every doorway people were pouring out
into the street. The sidewalks were jammed.
The roadway was so crowded with busses and
trucks and drays and trolley-cars and automobiles
that it was next to impossible to cross it.
Bells were clanging, automobile horns honking,
whistles blowing. Iron-shod hoofs rang on the
pavements. Leather shoes scraped and shuffled
on the stone sidewalks. And all these noises
combined in one ceaseless roar that beat on the
ear incessantly. But what most impressed Roy
was the unceasing rush of people. Apparently
there was no end to them. Doorways of high
buildings fairly vomited human beings. But no
matter how many persons issued forth, more remained
to come out. Time and time again Roy
had seen this evening rush for home, and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
he was impressed by it. It seemed impossible
that there could be so many workers in the city.
But when he remembered that some of the tall
buildings about him held as many as ten thousand
persons,&mdash;almost as many people as there were
in the whole town of Central City&mdash;the rush did
not seem so incomprehensible. Every time Roy
looked at the crowd he thought of the ceaseless
flow of a rushing stream.</p>

<p>Roy paused when he reached 41 Broadway and
read the tablet on the wall. But he passed on
quickly, for the crowded sidewalk was a poor
place to loiter, and the tumult of traffic drove
from his head all thoughts of those sleepy old
days when New York was New Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Roy was now in the very heart of that deep
canyon formed by the huge buildings in lower
Broadway. He knew that nowhere else in the
world could one find structures like them. There
they towered, ten, twenty, thirty, forty stories
high, until it made one almost dizzy to look up at
them. Like the traffic in the street, Roy had
seen them often; but now, as always when he saw
them near at hand, he marveled at these huge
structures man had reared two and even three
times as high as Niagara, while the gigantic
Woolworth Building, more than four and a half
times the height of Niagara, towered a full seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
hundred and fifty feet above the sidewalk. As
Roy looked up Broadway at it now he could not
help feeling awed.</p>

<p>“Just think,” he muttered, “it’s two hundred
feet longer than the <em>Lycoming</em>.”</p>

<p>Just then Roy came to a quick lunch room.
His eye brightened as he caught sight of it, for
he had had nothing to eat for several hours, and
the salt breeze in the park had whetted an appetite
already keen.</p>

<p>Roy entered and ate generously. He took his
time about it. Now that he was relaxed, he
found that he was really tired. When he came
out of the restaurant he was amazed at the altered
appearance of the street. The crowd had disappeared.
Gone was the multitude of trucks, drays
and motor-cars. A few belated pedestrians were
hurrying along the street, and an occasional
wagon rattled by. But now every hoof beat and
every creak of wheel or wagon-body echoed
through the deserted thoroughfare, flung back by
the empty hives of buildings that had so recently
swarmed with life. More than ever Roy thought
of that rushing throng of humanity as a surging
tide; but now it seemed as though a sluice-gate
had somewhere been closed and only a few tiny
trickles were seeping through.</p>

<p>But somehow the deserted thoroughfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
seemed almost more attractive to Roy than it did
when it was seething with traffic. There was so
much he wanted to think about, so many things
on every hand that demanded consideration; and
connected thought was almost impossible when
so many persons were rushing by and such a confusing
babel of sound smote on the ear. So now
he sauntered slowly up Broadway, thinking about
his own situation, and pondering over the interesting
things he had seen.</p>

<p>One by one lights shone forth in the great
structures about him&mdash;lights so high that they
seemed like yellow stars in the sky. Slowly the
outlines of the individual buildings grew dim and
uncertain as darkness came on. In place of the
hulking massive structures of stone he had been
looking at by daylight, Roy now found himself
gazing at what seemed like fairy towers of twinkling,
elfin lights. It was wonderful beyond description.
But when Roy looked at the Singer
and Woolworth Buildings, with their beautiful
towers of ornate stone rising hundreds of feet
above him and brilliantly illuminated by hidden
lights, he was sure that he had never in his life
seen anything so beautiful and so wonderful. He
could find no words to express his delight. But
he was conscious that the feeling of awe which
had gripped him as he stared at these same colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
shafts by day was gone. Now he felt only
a sense of charm and delight.</p>

<p>He continued up Broadway until he came to
the seething centre of life about City Hall.
When he looked across the little park at the entrance
of the Brooklyn bridge, and saw the bustling
activity of Park Row, he could scarce believe
that one short block could make so great a
difference. Roy did not realize that Park Row
was the heart of the night life of lower New
York. Centred about it were the homes of many
of New York’s great newspapers, where scores of
workers had just gone on duty and where the
“day’s work” was only fairly getting under
way.</p>

<p>Roy made his way to the entrance of the
Brooklyn bridge and watched in wonder the endless
strings of trolley-cars swing round the terminal
loops, the streams of pedestrians still pouring
homeward toward Brooklyn, the line of carts
still rattling up the cobbled roadway to the
bridge. When he expressed his wonder to the
bridge policeman at the information booth, that
individual only smiled. For years he had
watched the better part of a million people daily
swarm to and fro across the bridge; and the tail-end
of the evening rush, that seemed so impressive
to Roy, was commonplace enough to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>After a time the scene paled on Roy, and he
started for home&mdash;his new home on the <em>Lycoming</em>.
Knowing well the city’s geography, he did
not retrace his steps but struck off directly for
the western water-front, passing through a maze
of deserted, dimly lighted, little streets that were
flanked by dingy buildings of five or six stories.
The contrast with the blazing centre of life he had
just left was as striking as some sudden shift in
scenes on the stage of a theatre. In the quiet
and gloom Roy had abundant opportunity for
thought. His mind returned to the problem
immediately before him: how he should make
good with Captain Lansford.</p>

<p>So engrossed in this problem did Roy become
that he did not hear a stealthy footstep behind
him, and was startled when a form appeared beside
him, and a tough-looking fellow demanded a
match.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Roy, “but I have no matches
with me.”</p>

<p>“Then give me ten cents for beer,” growled
the fellow in a still rougher tone.</p>

<p>“I have no money to give you,” said Roy
firmly.</p>

<p>“You haven’t, eh?” sneered the fellow.
“Then I’ll just take it.”</p>

<p>He grasped Roy’s shoulder, but Roy wrenched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
loose from him and drew back. Quick as a flash
the ruffian shot his fist at Roy’s face. Taken unawares,
Roy could not dodge the blow, and it
landed full on his left eye. For an instant he
was almost stunned and he could see nothing.
Instinctively he drew back and raised his fists to
protect himself. Roy knew that he was no match
for this hulking fellow, who was almost as large
as Captain Lansford, but he meant to fight to the
limit to save the few dollars he possessed. Roy
believed that the best defense was an offensive,
and though he could hardly see the man before
him, he rushed at him and struck out with all his
might. The fellow was as much surprised as
Roy had been an instant before and the blow
struck him squarely on the chin. He had been
coming toward Roy and the impact was terrific.
It bent his head straight back and the fellow
dropped to his knees. Roy should have finished
him with another blow, but he could not hit a man
who was down, even though the man had attempted
to rob him. He stepped past the man
and walked rapidly toward the water-front, frequently
glancing over his shoulder lest he be pursued.
But the surprised robber had had enough.
When he was able to get to his feet he slunk
quickly out of sight.</p>

<p>“I got out of that pretty lucky,” thought Roy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
“I’d rather have a black eye any time than lose
my money.”</p>

<p>But Roy almost changed his mind when he
reached the ship, for the first person he met was
Captain Lansford. By this time Roy’s eye was
both swollen and discolored, and his face was
flushed with excitement. As luck would have it,
he met the captain in the full glare of a bright
light.</p>

<p>“So you’ve been drinking, eh?” roared the
captain. “Don’t you know that drinking is forbidden
on this ship?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t been drinking, sir,” said Roy.
“Some one&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Captain Lansford cut him short. “Don’t
make it worse by lying about it,” he said
harshly.</p>

<p>Roy’s flushed face grew redder still with indignation.
“You have no right to say that,” he
declared hotly.</p>

<p>“Do you dare question my authority on my
own ship?” thundered the irate commander.</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether you are captain of this
ship or President of the United States,” said Roy
boldly. “You shall not accuse me of either
drinking or lying. I never touched a drop of
liquor in my life and I am not a liar.”</p>

<p>“If you haven’t been drinking,” demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Captain Lansford, “how did you get that black
eye?”</p>

<p>“A man set on me and tried to rob me,” replied
Roy.</p>

<p>“And you were sober and you let him hit you
in the eye? Bah!”</p>

<p>“He hit me when I wasn’t expecting it,” explained
Roy.</p>

<p>“And what did you do? Run? Or hand him
your money?”</p>

<p>“I knocked him down,” said Roy grimly.</p>

<p>“It’s likely,” rejoined the captain. “Now go
to your quarters and don’t ever let me hear of
your drinking again.”</p>

<p>Anger flamed up in Roy’s heart. “Don’t you
ever dare to accuse me of drinking again,” he
cried hotly, taking a step toward his superior and
looking him straight in the eye.</p>

<p>“Go to your quarters,” thundered the captain.</p>

<p>Roy turned and slowly mounted to the wireless
house. At every step his heart grew heavier and
heavier.</p>

<p>“A nice mess I’ve made of it,” he sighed, when
at last he reached the wireless house and threw
himself down on his couch. “I’ll never make
good with the captain now, never.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A FRIEND IN NEED</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">It was characteristic of Roy that he did not
spend much time bewailing his misfortune. “If
the captain objects to my looks now,” thought
he, “how will he feel to-morrow, when that black
eye becomes the real thing! Gee! I’ve got to
do something quick. Let me see. It ought to
be bathed in warm water and rubbed with butter
or some other kind of grease. I can get warm
water here in my room, but I don’t know where
to get butter. Maybe the cook would give me
some.”</p>

<p>Roy jumped to his feet and started down the
ladder. “Gee whiz!” he muttered. “I wonder
where the cook is?” For the <em>Lycoming</em> was still
a mystery to Roy.</p>

<p>He went down to a lower deck, then stood irresolute.
Not a soul was in sight, the ship was
dimly lighted, and Roy did not know which way
to turn. Suddenly the door of the purser’s office
was flung open and a flood of yellow light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
streamed out. Roy stepped quickly to the door
and knocked against the jamb.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said a hearty voice, which Roy was
certain he had heard before.</p>

<p>Roy entered and found himself face to face
with the man whose letter he had rescued. He
was so surprised that for an instant he couldn’t
say a word.</p>

<p>“Hello, youngster,” said the man, as he took
a quick glance at Roy. “Glad to see you. Come
in. Just let me finish this manifest and I’ll talk
to you all night.” But when he took a second
look at Roy, he dropped the sheaf of papers he
was examining and stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Now how the deuce did you get that?” he
exclaimed, as he examined Roy’s eye.</p>

<p>As Roy started to tell him he interrupted,
“Never mind how you got it. Let’s get it fixed
first and talk about it afterward. Come with me,
youngster.”</p>

<p>He darted out of his office and into his stateroom,
with Roy close at his heels. Seemingly
with one motion he set the hot water flowing in
his wash-bowl and drew from a closet a bottle of
vaseline. Almost before Roy knew what was
happening, the man had him in a chair with a
stinging hot compress over his eye, and another
ready for application when the first one cooled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
The man’s dexterity amazed Roy, who was anything
but clumsy himself. When the compresses
had done their work, the man began to rub the
injured flesh about the bruised eye with vaseline.
Round and round his fingers went, softly but
firmly pressing the flesh, until Roy wondered if
the man would ever stop. Finally the massage
ended and a poultice was quickly made and deftly
applied.</p>

<p>“There,” said the man, stepping back and
viewing his job critically. “You’re fixed up as
good as any ambulance surgeon could have fixed
you. Now let’s hear how you got that decoration.”</p>

<p>“First, let me thank you for your help,” said
Roy gratefully. “I’ll look bad enough as it is,
but I’d have looked a thousand times worse if you
hadn’t helped me. I wouldn’t care so much if
the captain hadn’t seen me.”</p>

<p>“Did he, though? And what did he say?”</p>

<p>“He accused me of being drunk, and when I
tried to explain how I came by a black eye, he
told me not to make it worse by lying.”</p>

<p>Roy’s companion chuckled. “What did you
tell him?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I told him he had no right to accuse me of
either. He nearly took my head off, and demanded
to know if I questioned his authority on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
his own ship. I told him I didn’t care whether
he was captain of the <em>Lycoming</em> or President of
the United States, I was neither drunk nor a liar
and that he had no right to accuse me of being
either.”</p>

<p>Roy’s companion slapped his leg in huge delight.
“Boy,” he said, “you’re made with Captain
Lansford. You couldn’t have done anything
that would please him more. He loves
courage and there are mighty few people who
have enough of it to stand up to him.”</p>

<p>Roy looked rueful. “He’ll never forgive
me,” he said. “You should have heard him
order me to my quarters.”</p>

<p>But Roy’s companion only chuckled. “Now
tell me all about your eye,” he said.</p>

<p>Roy told him how he came by it. Then he
added, “I suppose you are the purser, and I’m
mighty glad. I don’t know how I can ever show
my gratitude for your kindness, but I thank you
with all my heart. My name is Roy Mercer.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, lad. Thank you,” said the
purser. “It’s always a pleasure to help a good
boy like yourself. My name is Robbins, Frank
Robbins, and I <em>am</em> the purser. I foresee that we
shall be very good friends.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Roy. “It won’t be my fault
if we aren’t. Won’t you come up and see my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
wireless room? And, by the way, I’ve got some
crullers my mother gave me. You must try
them.”</p>

<p>“God bless the lad!” ejaculated the purser.
“Crullers&mdash;the kind that mother used to make&mdash;the
real thing&mdash;and he wants to share them. To
be sure, I’ll come. But let me finish that manifest
first. Work before play is the motto on this
ship.”</p>

<p>“I’d bet on that,” thought Roy, “if Captain
Lansford had anything to do with it.”</p>

<p>The purser went to his office and Roy to the
wireless house. But what a different lad he was
from the Roy who had left it so short a time before.
He had found a friend in need; and a
friend in need is a friend indeed. Now his eyes
were aglow and his heart beat merrily. He
looked at his shining instruments as a mother
views her child. Sitting down at the operating
table, he adjusted his receivers to his head and
threw over the switch.</p>

<p>A babel of sound smote his ears. It was after
nine o’clock, and at that hour of the night the air
in Manhattan was as noisy as Broadway during
the rush hour. Everybody was talking at once,
including no end of irresponsible amateurs, many
of whom could send but not read. When they
jammed, no one could tell them what trouble they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
were making for everybody else. Roy could
hear big stations and little talking to one another
through hundreds of miles of space. Stations
far to the northward were talking directly over
Roy’s head, as it were, with stations as far to the
southward. Inland operators were conversing
with shore stations, and ocean liners were exchanging
messages with operators on land. It
was as noisy as a five o’clock tea.</p>

<p>Though it was all familiar to Roy, it was as
interesting to him as if he were hearing it for the
first time. High above the multitude of buzzing
sounds rose the shrill whine of the Brooklyn
Navy Yard’s rotary spark-gap. Always Roy
delighted to listen to the clean, clear work of the
Navy Yard operators. Now he tuned sharply
and listened.</p>

<p>“NAK&mdash;NAK&mdash;NAK&mdash;NAH,” called the
navy operator. (Annapolis-Brooklyn Navy
Yard calling.)</p>

<p>“NAH&mdash;III&mdash;GA,” came the reply almost
at once. (Navy Yard. I’m here. Go ahead.)</p>

<p>Roy made a wry face as he took down the message
that followed. It was in cipher and he
could not read it.</p>

<p>But there was plenty that he could read. The
radio station on the Metropolitan tower was
shrilly shouting its news to the world. The navy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
station at Fire Island was talking with a destroyer
at sea. Cape May was trying to get some ship
far out in the Atlantic. The <cite>New York Herald</cite>
was talking with a ship coming into Boston. Far
out at sea the White Star liner <em>Majestic</em> was inquiring
whether the Giants or Cincinnati had
won the day’s ball game. The Hotel Waldorf
was sending a message for a guest to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Suddenly Roy started violently. His own
call was sounding through the air: “WNA&mdash;WNA&mdash;WNA&mdash;WNG.”</p>

<p>It was the <em>Tioga</em> calling her sister ship <em>Lycoming</em>.</p>

<p>“WNG&mdash;III&mdash;GA,” flashed back Roy the
instant the call ended.</p>

<p>“Hello,” came the answer. “This is Patterson.
Who are you?”</p>

<p>“This is Mercer,” answered Roy.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you,” flashed back the operator
on the <em>Tioga</em>. “Where you from?”</p>

<p>“This is my first job,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re right on the job and you send
well.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” answered Roy. “Come see me.
When do you expect to get in?”</p>

<p>“Tuesday evening. Take a message for Lansford.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Roy took down the message and said good-night
to Patterson. He made a grimace at the
thought of again facing “the old dragon,” as he
mentally styled his superior. But before he
could lay aside his receivers he heard Arlington
preparing to send out the ten o’clock time signal
and the day’s weather news.</p>

<p>“I’ll just take the weather-report,” he thought,
as he set his watch, “and give it to Captain Lansford
along with this message.”</p>

<p>Then the weather signals sounded. Rapidly
Roy jotted them down: “USWB-T 02813&mdash;DB
04221&mdash;H 03622&mdash;C 03042&mdash;K 00223&mdash;P
03347.” (Wind off Atlantic Coast&mdash;north of
Sandy Hook moderate northerly winds with fair
weather&mdash;Hatteras to Florida Straits moderate
northerly and easterly winds. Moderate showers
Tuesday east Gulf Coast. Fresh to moderately
strong winds over north portion with rain&mdash;moderate
northeast and east winds over south portion.)</p>

<p>Rapidly Roy deciphered the code and wrote
down the despatch, as follows: Nantucket&mdash;barometer
30.28, wind north, gentle breeze. Delaware
Breakwater&mdash;barometer 30.42, wind northeast,
light air. Cape Hatteras&mdash;barometer 30.36,
wind northeast, light breeze. Key West&mdash;barometer
30.02, wind northeast, gentle breeze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Pensacola&mdash;barometer 30.33, wind southeast,
moderate gale.</p>

<p>Carefully Roy wrote out the message from the
<em>Tioga</em>, and signed it with the <em>Tioga</em> captain’s
name, making sure that every word was written
plainly and spelled correctly. “I won’t give him
a chance to criticize me,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Then, after a moment’s consideration, he
wrote: “The United States Weather Bureau
reports the following weather conditions.” And
he copied down the deciphered message and
signed his name: “Mercer.”</p>

<p>It was the first time Roy had ever signed his
name as a professional operator and he thrilled
with pride as he looked at the neatly penned message
with his own signature at the bottom.</p>

<p>But immediately the smile of satisfaction was
succeeded by a sour look. At that instant his
door opened and the purser walked in.</p>

<p>“Why so glum?” he demanded. “Worrying
about your shiner?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Roy. “I was thinking how much
fun it will be to take this message to Captain
Lansford.”</p>

<p>“Now see here, lad,” exploded the purser.
“You’re not going to take it. Don’t forget
you’re not a cabin-boy, but remember that you
rank with the officers. And, anyway, it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
just as well to keep away from the captain for a
time. He’s used to having everybody kotow to
him. Just show him you are independent. He
won’t think any the worse of you for it.”</p>

<p>“Come to think of it,” said Roy, “his orders
were to go to the wireless house and not to bother
him.”</p>

<p>“Just push this button when you want a steward,”
said the purser, putting his finger on a
push-button in the wall that Roy had not previously
noticed.</p>

<p>In a few moments a gray-haired negro appeared
at the door.</p>

<p>“Sam,” said the purser, “this is Mr. Mercer,
our new wireless man. He’s a particular friend
of mine and I want you to look after him as a
favor to me. Besides, you want to gain his
friendship yourself. You can never tell when
you may need his help. He talks to other ships
and to folks ashore, with these instruments here.
If we get into trouble at sea he can summon help,
even if we are five hundred miles out in the
ocean.”</p>

<p>The darky’s eyes opened wide in astonishment.
“I done heerd o’ dis yere wireless telefagry,
Massa Robbins,” he said, “but I ain’t never seen
none before. Can he really call help like
dat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed he can, Sam, and if we need a policeman,
he can get one quick.”</p>

<p>The steward looked at Roy with awe. Roy
rose and shook hands with him. “I hope you are
going to be my friend, Sam,” he said cordially.</p>

<p>“’Deed I is, Mr. Mercer. ’Deed I is, suh,” and
he bowed himself out with Roy’s message for the
captain.</p>

<p>Roy grinned at the purser. “Sounds funny to
have him call me Mr. Mercer,” he said. “I suppose
he’ll get over it when he knows me better.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never be anything but Mr. Mercer on
shipboard,” explained the purser. “As wireless
man, you are entitled to be called Mr. Mercer,
and we are particular about such things. But
I’m going to call you Roy when we’re alone, if
you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>With a smile Roy laid aside his wireless instruments
and produced his package of crullers.</p>

<p>“We must have something to drink with
these,” said the purser, and he pressed the button
again.</p>

<p>Roy looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>“I never touch anything stronger than coffee,”
said the purser, “and if you take my advice, you
won’t, either.”</p>

<p>“I never touched a drop of liquor in my life,”
said Roy, “and I’m not going to now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought not,” said the purser. “That’s
one reason I mean to be your friend. Boys who
drink aren’t worth bothering with.”</p>

<p>Presently Sam answered the bell and brought
them a pot of steaming hot coffee. For a long
time Roy and the purser sat talking; they ate
crullers and drank coffee. When Mr. Robbins
said good-night, Roy was very happy indeed.
He felt that he had gained a real friend, who
would help him in difficulty. And, though he did
not know it, there were many difficulties ahead
of him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">OFF TO SEA</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Thanks to the purser’s kind and skilful
ministrations, Roy’s eye was not long in returning
to an almost normal appearance. But
Roy had little time to worry over his looks. As
the time for sailing approached, he was busy day
and night. There were a multitude of unusual
details connected with the maiden voyage of the
<em>Lycoming</em> that entailed endless messages. The
ship’s owners were continually sending important
communications. Commanders of other Confederated
liners sent congratulations to the <em>Lycoming’s</em>
commander. Shipping agents and
commercial houses fairly bombarded Captain
Lansford with wireless communications. Finally
passengers began to arrive and messages were
sent to and by them.</p>

<p>Even Roy, ignorant as he still was of matters
nautical and commercial, could see that things
were not going right. The ship still had to be
coaled, and the coal barges were badly delayed in
arriving. Certain big freight shipments, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
it was imperative for the <em>Lycoming</em> to carry, were
held back by the congested condition of the railways.
The first of these shipments began to arrive
about the time the last should have been
safely stowed in the hold. Captain Lansford
was plainly disturbed. He grew sharper and
sharper tempered. He drove the stevedores at
an incredible pace. He made the coal-passers
work at a speed past belief. But the thing that
seemed to annoy him most was the continual
stream of wireless messages. Every succeeding
communication seemed to put a sharper edge to
his temper. From the first officer down to the
humblest coal-passer, every member of the crew
was on the alert. At the least word from Captain
Lansford they jumped to execute his command.
Despite the innumerable delays and obstacles,
it looked as though the ship would sail on
time.</p>

<p>When Roy had said to himself that his job was
to help keep the ship safe and on the dot, he
meant it. By the terms of his employment he
was required to be at his post at certain hours and
to listen in at certain intervals. But Roy saw
that already opportunity had come to him to be
of real help to his captain. An hour’s delay in
some of the messages that were arriving, he
quickly saw, would make a great deal of difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to Captain Lansford and the sailing of the
ship. So Roy threw aside all idea of working
during prescribed hours only and stuck to his
post. Indeed, he hardly left the wireless house,
even for meals. Sam, the steward, was as anxious
to win Roy’s good-will as Roy was to gain the
captain’s, and he saw to it that Roy did not lack
good things to eat or drink. It was hard to be
confined so closely. And when there was so
much near at hand that he wanted to see, it took
real courage to force himself to stay in the wireless
house. But Roy put aside his desire for
sightseeing, sent and received his messages
promptly, and made sure that communications
for Captain Lansford were always put into the
commander’s hands immediately. Especially
was Roy particular to spell his words correctly,
write them plainly, and get all his figures correct.</p>

<p>The purser had arranged to have a cabin-boy
deliver the captain’s messages, and Roy was glad
enough that he did not have to face Captain
Lansford. As for the latter, he gave no sign
that he either understood or appreciated the service
Roy was rendering him. On the contrary, he
lost no opportunity to condemn the innovation
that had been forced on him. The cabin-boy,
who disliked the task assigned to him, repeated to
Roy all the harsh things that Captain Lansford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
said to him. But Roy only screwed his lips together
a little tighter and stuck to his job. It
was the only way he knew of to make good.</p>

<p>As the hour for sailing approached, the activities
on the pier were past describing. Roy had
thought the stevedores worked fast when he saw
them. If he could have watched them now he
would hardly have believed his eyes. Hour after
hour, in unending streams they rushed down the
gangplanks with their enormous loads. Drays
came and went. Drivers swore frantically at
their horses and at one another. Motors honked
and roared. Boxes and bales crashed to the floor
of the pier shed with resounding thumps. The
little hand-trucks rattled incessantly over the uneven
planking. Donkey-engines and steam-winches
clanked and shrieked, and the derricks
groaned and creaked as load after load was
hoisted aboard. Every hand that could be employed
in loading was working at top speed. The
scene would have delighted Roy. But, like the
coal-passers, the stevedores, the truckmen, the
crew, and everybody else about the ship, he, too,
was working at top speed. It seemed as though
each one of the scores of men who were toiling
about the ship was determined that the ship
should sail on time, cost what it might. A very
frenzy seemed to have taken possession of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
these toilers. Something had gotten into them,
some spirit that made it seem more important to
get the <em>Lycoming</em> off on time than to do anything
else in the world. Like everybody else aboard,
Roy was too busy to think about the thing or even
to comprehend that a miracle was taking place
under his very nose.</p>

<p>Yet a miracle it was. For a few minutes before
the hour for sailing arrived, the final bale of
freight was stowed in the hold, some of the
hatches were battened down, and the gangplanks
drawn ashore. The <em>Lycoming</em> would sail on
time.</p>

<p>With a frightful shriek of her great whistle, the
huge ship gradually moved astern, sliding slowly
out of its dock into the broad Hudson, where
boats were crossing and recrossing and passing
up and down like shuttles in a loom. The air was
vibrant with their shrill, incessant tootings. Ponderously
the huge craft, pushed by snorting little
tugs, turned its nose down-stream, headed for the
open sea, and with quickening speed majestically
slid through the tossing waters, with Captain
Lansford, erect as a pine and as motionless,
watching like an eagle on the bridge.</p>

<p>Roy had lost none of his dislike for this harsh-tempered
commander. But when he saw him
standing thus at his post, like a veritable Gibraltar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Roy gained a new conception of the man’s
character. Suddenly there came to him an appreciation
of the fact that Captain Lansford
alone had made it possible to sail on time. Men,
whom money would not budge, had worked like
mad at his mere command. Obstacles that were
seemingly insurmountable had been overcome.
Work that was apparently impossible had been
accomplished. Roy did not understand it at all,
yet he began to realize that there was something
in his commander that rose superior to obstacles
and carried his fellows with him. Instinctively
Roy felt safer because of that silent, immovable
figure on the bridge.</p>

<p>“But it makes it all the tougher for me,” he
thought. “He’s got it in for me, and I know
he’ll never forgive me for talking to him as I
did.”</p>

<p>Now that the pressure was relaxed, Roy was
too busy seeing things to worry about the matter,
for the <em>Lycoming</em> was fast picking up speed.</p>

<p>“Toot! Toot! Toot!” went the <em>Lycoming’s</em>
whistle, as one vessel after another saluted the
new craft. “Toot!” it shrieked; “Toot! Toot!”
as approaching craft indicated that they would
pass to right or left.</p>

<p>Now far out from the shore, the ship had left
behind her the roar of the water-front. Gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
were the stench and dust of the streets, and the
noise of traffic. Hidden from sight were the sordid
and ugly features of the city. The great
buildings seemed like dream structures. A fairy
city, indeed, appeared the great American metropolis
as it shone in the summer sun. To Roy
it was fairer than any city he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Shortly the ship was passing Bedloe’s Island,
with its towering statue of Liberty. Never had
Roy been so close to the giant goddess. Always
his heart thrilled at the sight of this emblem of
Democracy. He was still a boy, but he was beginning
to understand what is meant by that
word Democracy. It meant opportunity to
climb up, to get ahead, even as he was now starting
to do; and Roy resolved that he would let
nothing, absolutely nothing, stand between him
and duty. For, as he looked at that immovable
figure on the bridge, Roy realized more keenly
than ever that if anything at all could help him
to make good with his captain, it would be
through doing his duty&mdash;just his plain, every-day
duty as it came to him.</p>

<p>Soon the statue of Liberty was far to the rear.
Past Robbin’s Reef light, past quarantine,
through the Narrows, past the forts on either side
that dominate the narrow neck of water, and on
into the lower bay, sped the <em>Lycoming</em>. Ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
loomed Hoffman’s and Swinburne’s Islands, the
latter with its imposing hospital buildings, where
quarantined immigrants are treated. On the
right, ever receding, were the low-lying shores of
New Jersey. Far to the left lay Coney Island,
Manhattan Beach, Rockaway, and other famous
pleasure resorts on the south shore of Long
Island. While straight ahead rolled the illimitable
ocean, the goal of Roy’s desire.</p>

<p>Presently Roy heard a step on the iron ladder
leading to his perch and a moment later the
purser joined him.</p>

<p>“Now,” said that individual, with a sigh, “we
can let down a bit. When it comes to being a
slave-driver neither Pharaoh nor Simon Legree
had anything on Captain Lansford. But he got
us off on time, didn’t he?” And the purser
chuckled as though all his hard work of the past
few days was a good joke.</p>

<p>On the right the Atlantic Highlands were
looming up, and the purser, who had a powerful
glass in his hand, pointed out to Roy the range-lights
that help to guide the mariner in the dark.
Soon the <em>Lycoming</em> was off Sandy Hook, that
low-lying finger of sand, with its fort and a lighthouse
at the very tip.</p>

<p>“Ever read Cooper’s <cite>Water Witch</cite>?” asked
the purser, and Roy nodded, “Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you’ll remember that famous little
craft used to elude her pursuers by sailing into
Sandy Hook Bay there&mdash;the body of water enclosed
by the Hook&mdash;and slipping out to sea
through a break in the Hook itself.”</p>

<p>“Was that the place?” asked Roy, all interest.</p>

<p>“That’s it, all right, but the break in the Hook
has long since filled up and Uncle Sam now has
a little railway that runs along that narrow neck
of sand out to the proving-grounds. You know
some of the big guns for the army are tested here.
If you look carefully, you will see that the little
neck of sand is protected on the ocean side by
pilings and rocks. Otherwise a heavy storm
would wash the sand away and Sandy Hook
would soon be an island.”</p>

<p>Roy saw that the shore-line for miles was protected
by a heavy sheeting of piling and planks.</p>

<p>“It needs to be well protected,” said the purser,
when Roy drew his attention to the fact. “You
will notice that there is an almost unbroken row
of houses for miles along the ocean front. The
land is nothing but sand and is very low. If it
weren’t for the protection of these pilings, storms
would soon eat the sand away and the houses
would topple into the sea. In fact, it isn’t very
long since a big storm did get a number of
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem possible that such a thing
could happen,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“When you’ve seen one or two rough storms
and have watched the waves crashing over the
<em>Lycoming’s</em> decks, you’ll have a different idea of
the power of the ocean.”</p>

<p>“What?” said Roy. “Do the waves ever
sweep over the deck?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess,” said the purser. “Just
now the sea is as calm as a mill-pond, but let the
wind blow a little and you’ll see what a fuss it
will kick up.”</p>

<p>“But,” protested Roy, “the deck is many feet
above the water-line. Surely the waves don’t get
so high as that.”</p>

<p>“A good deal higher, youngster. They’ll roll
up close to thirty feet in a good storm, and that’s
as high as the average house or higher. Wait
till you see some of those huge combers come
crashing down on the deck and you won’t wonder
that they have to fortify the coast along here.
There isn’t a thing between here and Europe to
stop the waves, once they get to rolling.”</p>

<p>Roy whistled in amazement and took another
look at the ocean.</p>

<p>The <em>Lycoming</em> was now fairly at sea. In quick
succession she passed a string of towns so grown
together that there appeared to be but one long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
community. These were the numerous summer
resorts that occupy the narrow strip of land between
the Navesink River and the Atlantic
Ocean. With the purser’s strong glass Roy
could see from his high perch the crowds of
bathers on the long beach and motor-cars speeding
along the smooth boulevard that runs for
many miles close to the shore-line. As darkness
came on, the shore faded from sight. But in its
place innumerable twinkling lights sprang into
being, stretching in unbroken lines, like great
strings of glowing jewels, for miles and miles up
and down the coast, with brighter clusters here
and there like pendants, to mark the hearts of the
numerous towns.</p>

<p>From his high post atop the ship, Roy commanded
an unobstructed view for miles in every
direction. And in every direction lights twinkled.
Ashore, millions of lights shone steadily like
huge glowworms. The twin headlights of automobiles,
like giant, fiery eyes, turned this way or
that and darted through the darkness. Search-lights
pointed their long beams toward heaven,
where they swung, now here, now there, like
enormous pencils of light writing on the firmament.
As far as he could see, the coast-line was
pricked out in innumerable lights.</p>

<p>Seaward shone the lamps of occasional ships.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
In places single, low-lying, bright eyes in the
dark betokened the presence of small sailing
ships with lights in their rigging. Lanterns
gleamed aboard belated fishing ships, as they
made for the great metropolis with their cargoes
of sea food. And beyond them, but drawing
steadily nearer, a moving mass of lights indicated
the presence and approach of a great ocean liner.</p>

<p>Roy had only to turn his eyes heavenward to
see the faithful watch-lights that God so long ago
placed in the heavens, and that are still shining
undimmed to guide the footsteps of those who
struggle upward&mdash;even as Roy was doing.
Something of this he felt as he stood in silent
wonder, charmed by the myriad lights ashore,
fascinated by the bobbing gleams at sea, with
their hint of mystery and romance. The sea!
What things it had witnessed! What tragedies
it had seen! What adventures had occurred on
its heaving bosom! What acts of heroism had
taken place on its broad expanse!</p>

<p>Duty called Roy to the wireless house, for the
early part of the night was his busy hour afloat.
As he turned his back on the panorama of lights
and went to his post, he wondered what the sea
would bring to him. Hitherto he had thought
little about the dangerous side of life at sea.
Now he began to grasp the possibilities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
tragedy, to understand that not all of those who
go down to the sea in ships return safely. As he
looked out over the vast void and up into the
unfathomable firmament, he felt again that sense
of littleness and insignificance that had overwhelmed
him upon his arrival in New York.
But somehow there was a difference. The stars
did not terrify him as his callous fellow beings
had done. A sense of awe rather than fear
gripped him. Long he looked at the silent stars,
so calm, so imperturbable, and though it seemed
ridiculous to compare his commander to one of
God’s stars, he could not help thinking of that
calm, immovable figure he had last seen on the
bridge. Whether the night was fair, as it was
now, or the tempest raged and the wave-crests
hurled themselves upon the ship, Roy felt sure
that his commander would be at his post, unterrified.
With a prayer that he, too, might be found
at his post, unterrified, doing his duty calmly
when the pinch came, Roy took a final look at the
stars, slipped into the wireless house, and sat
down at his operating table, ready for the night’s
work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE NIGHT’S WORK</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Roy adjusted his receivers, threw over his
switch, and listened in. A grin came over
his face. The air was as noisy as the old football
field at home when Central City was winning.
Everybody was yelling through space at somebody
else. It was one terrific babel of wireless
voices. It seemed to Roy as though everybody
within three hundred miles who had a radio instrument
was using it. But through all the
racket he could plainly distinguish the whining
call of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. There was no
mistaking that station. Roy tuned in and caught
the message. It was an order for a torpedo-boat
destroyer to start from Newport News next day
for Brooklyn for an overhauling in the dry dock.
Then Roy shifted to a commercial wave-length
and caught a message from the incoming liner
<em>Kroonland</em>, asking the police boat to meet her at
quarantine to take off a card shark who had been
caught fleecing fellow-passengers. The Clyde
liner <em>Iroquois</em> was announcing to her owners her
probable hour of arrival from San Domingo.
The signals came so sharp and clear that Roy felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
certain they were sent from the steamer he had
noticed earlier in the evening, which was now
almost abreast of them.</p>

<p>Night after night he had listened to wireless
operators chatting to each other through the air,
exchanging gossip and friendly messages. He
hoped it would not be long before he became acquainted
with some of his fellow operators so that
he, too, could join in the evening gossip. But
Roy was reluctant to start a conversation with
a stranger. He feared he might be thought
“fresh.” Now, as he looked out of a window at
the glowing ship so near at hand, he suddenly
decided to talk with her, and see if she were the
<em>Iroquois</em>. In a minute he had found the <em>Iroquois</em>’
call in his wireless directory, and the minute
the <em>Iroquois</em> stopped talking he pressed his
key.</p>

<p>“KVF&mdash;KVF&mdash;KVF&mdash;WNA,” sounded his
signal, as the blue sparks leaped in his instrument.</p>

<p>Almost immediately came the reply, “WNA&mdash;III&mdash;GA.”</p>

<p>“Where are you, <em>Iroquois</em>?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Off the Jersey coast,” came the answer,
“about opposite Barnegat.”</p>

<p>“Is there a steamer between you and shore?”
flashed back Roy.</p>

<p>“Yes. What of it? Who wants to know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s us,” flashed back Roy, “the <em>Lycoming</em>.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of you. Are you a tramp?
Where from?”</p>

<p>“No. New Confederated liner&mdash;maiden voyage
New York to Galveston. Roy Mercer,
operator&mdash;just wanted to say howdy-do.”</p>

<p>“Congratulations and thanks,” came the reply.
“First job?”</p>

<p>“Very first.”</p>

<p>“Good luck. How did the Giants make out
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t heard,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, old top. My name’s Graham.
Call me up again.” And the <em>Iroquois</em> passed on,
while Roy got his messages ready for transmittal.</p>

<p>There were not many of these. The captain
had filed a final report for the owners: a Wall
Street broker ordered the sale of a thousand
shares of United States Steel if the market rose.
A salesman from Toledo wanted his firm to inform
him when he could guarantee delivery of
some machinery he had sold. And the usual
number of pleasure-seekers were sending messages
to their homes, announcing their departure
from New York. Roy sent off the captain’s
communication first, then quickly got rid of his
commercial messages. For a long time he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
at his table, listening to the interesting messages
that were pulsating through the nocturnal air.
He felt sure that as long as he lived he could
never grow tired of listening to these interesting
voices of the night.</p>

<p>When ten o’clock approached, he tuned to the
Arlington wave-length and waited to catch the
time and weather signals. Later still, he listened
in for the daily news-letter sent out each night by
the Marconi Company, for publication next day
in the marine newspapers that wireless telegraphy
had made possible on shipboard. The <em>Lycoming</em>
had not subscribed to this service and it was not
permissible for Roy to give out the news. But
there was nothing to prevent him from picking it
out of the air for his own information, or from
giving it to the captain. In fact, the Marconi
Company rather expected this as a courtesy to
captains on ships using their service. So Roy
was particular to take every word of the eight-hundred-word
news-letter that was flashed forth
to the world late that night.</p>

<p>The German peace delegates had handed their
reply, containing counter proposals, to the secretariat
of the peace commission. The despatch
gave the main points in the hundred-and-forty-six-page
answer of the Germans. A troop call
had been issued in Toronto in readiness for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
pending strike of workers. A new rebellion was
anticipated in Ireland. Captain Andre Tardieu
had made a remarkable appeal to ten thousand
soldiers of the American Expeditionary Force
for a closer union between France and America.
The baseball scores were given and Roy was
pleased to learn that the Giants had beaten
Brooklyn five to two and increased their lead.
Hereafter he would be a Giant fan. He wondered
if Graham, on the <em>Iroquois</em>, had caught the
news and was almost tempted to call him up.
There was a brief résumé of stock market conditions.
But what interested Roy most was the
announcement that the NC-4 would make its
last lap next day from Lisbon to London.</p>

<p>Roy had often picked these nightly news reports
from the air, but never before had they
meant to him what this message meant now. Always
before, he had been on land and had read in
the evening papers much of the news included in
the nightly news-letter. Now he was at sea.
Every hour carried the <em>Lycoming</em> farther from
shore. By morning, perhaps, she would be out
of sight of land. Already Roy was beginning to
feel that sense of isolation, of loneness, that
comes to first voyagers on the sea. When he
thought of all the ships that had gone down and
all the people who had perished when help was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
really but a few hours distant, he thrilled anew
at the thought that he could talk to other ships,
even if they were hundreds of miles away, and so
get help or bring help. With this thought came
a new sense of the importance of his post. Truly
his was a vital share in sailing the ship. It called
for the best there was in him.</p>

<p>By the time he had copied the weather-report
and the news-letter, it was so late he thought the
captain was probably asleep. Every night since
Roy came aboard, he had sent the weather-report
to Captain Lansford as soon as he had received
it. The captain had never acknowledged the
receipt of these messages nor indicated that he
was pleased to have them. Yet Roy thought the
commander ought to know about the weather.
He was in a quandary. Should he risk the wrath
of the captain by taking the message to him, or
should he wait until morning and send it? Roy
thought the matter over.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take it to him,” he said, finally.
“He ought to have this report and I’ll see that he
gets it, no matter what happens.”</p>

<p>He picked up the sheet of paper, skipped down
the ladder, and presently found himself before
the door of the captain’s cabin. His rather hesitating
knock was greeted by a gruff voice from
within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“This is the wireless man with the weather-report
and the night’s news, Captain,” replied Roy.</p>

<p>An angry exclamation was Roy’s answer.
The door was flung open, and the captain, in his
pajamas, stood in the doorway, boiling with
wrath.</p>

<p>“Weather-report!” he bellowed contemptuously.
“Weather-report! What do I want of
your weather-reports? Don’t you know better
than to come battering at my door in the middle
of the night? I left word that I should not be
disturbed, and here you come bothering me with
weather-reports. I’ll have obedience on shipboard,
sir, or I’ll put you in irons. Now get out.
And don’t you ever bother me again with your
weather-reports.”</p>

<p>“But, Captain Lansford,” objected Roy, “I
thought you might want to know the news, and
I have the day’s news-letter as well as the
weather-report. I did not know that you were
asleep or that you had left orders not to be disturbed.
I am sorry, sir. I only wished to be
of use, not to annoy you.”</p>

<p>“Bah! More of your wireless nonsense!”
roared the captain, and he banged his door shut.
Yet he snatched Roy’s papers, weather-report
and all, before he did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Roy turned back toward the wireless house, but
his encounter with the captain had driven every
vestige of sleepiness from his eyes. He decided
that he would look about the ship a bit. It was
cool and pleasant and there were no passengers
to bother him. It was against the rules for passengers
to visit the wireless house, but already
several had asked Roy for permission to do so.
Roy hardly knew how to refuse such a request
without seeming rude, so he was glad to avoid
passengers. He walked aft and for a while stood
looking over the taffrail at the foaming trail the
<em>Lycoming</em> left behind her. Then he went forward
and looked ahead. There was no moon,
but the stars shone clear and it was surprisingly
light. The smallest object would have been
visible on the water at a considerable distance.
In the very nose of the boat was a sailor on watch.
The man stood so motionless and leaned so snugly
against the bow that Roy was not at first certain
the figure was a man. He was tempted to go
talk with him, but remembered in time that it is
forbidden to converse with the men on watch.
So he leaned over the rail and quietly watched
the huge bow wave. He was close to the ladder
that leads to the bridge.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice, very low, but clear and distinct,
said, “Come up here, Mr. Mercer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Roy looked up and saw Mr. Young, the first
officer, standing above him on the bridge.
Quickly he scrambled up the ladder and found
himself beside the man in command of the <em>Lycoming</em>.
Roy knew that passengers were forbidden
on the bridge, and was fearful lest he
might be trespassing himself. But Mr. Young
soon dispelled his fears.</p>

<p>“As wireless man,” he said, “you have a perfect
right to come on the bridge, though it might
be as well not to do so when the captain is here.
You know he has some peculiar ideas.”</p>

<p>Mr. Young smiled, yet there was nothing unkind
in his smile. Like the purser, the first mate
seemed to have some feeling of kindness toward
his superior. Roy wondered at it. He did not
see how anybody could feel kindly toward such a
gruff old dragon. He was the more surprised
because Mr. Young, like Purser Robbins, was
the very soul of good nature. Roy had been attracted
to him from the start, for Mr. Young had
made an evident effort to put Roy at his ease.
Now he felt more grateful than ever to this great,
blond giant. For Mr. Young was even larger
than Captain Lansford.</p>

<p>Quietly the two conversed in the starlight,
though Mr. Young never took his eyes from the
water before them. Occasionally he spoke a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
word to the steersman behind him in the wheel-house.
He asked Roy many questions about his
life and seemed interested in him. Roy was immensely
pleased when Mr. Young remarked that
he was glad the ship was equipped with wireless
and that Roy was the operator. And Roy was
astonished beyond belief when Mr. Young told
him that he had sailed as first mate to Captain
Lansford for fifteen years. Roy did not see how
anybody who could possibly get another post
would willingly serve with Captain Lansford.
When he said as much to Mr. Young that officer
smiled.</p>

<p>“Wait until you know Captain Lansford a
little better,” said Mr. Young, “and you may
think differently.” But Roy was sure that nothing
could ever change his mind about Captain
Lansford. His most fervent wish was to do his
work satisfactorily for the next three months and
get a transfer to some other vessel.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when Roy sought his
bunk. But first he went to his instrument and
listened in for several minutes. If the sea was as
calm elsewhere as it was about the <em>Lycoming</em>, he
did not believe any ship could be in distress&mdash;unless
it might be from fire. Always, since he had
watched the flames on that Brooklyn pier, he was
thinking about fire at sea. If any vessel needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
help, he did not intend that it should lack assistance
through negligence on his part.</p>

<p>When finally Roy retired, he was weary
enough. Yet for a long time he could not sleep.
The unaccustomed throbbing of the great engines,
the vibration of the ship, and the unfamiliar
movement as the vessel rode the long, smooth
swells, kept Roy awake for a long time. Finally
he did sleep, but presently dreamed that Captain
Lansford was a real dragon and was about to
drown him. Roy awoke with a cry of terror and
found that his coat had slipped from its peg and
fallen across his face. In another minute he was
fast asleep again, and this time he slumbered
soundly until six bells in the morning watch,
when the striking of the ship’s bell awoke him.</p>

<p>Day after day the weather continued fair and
the sea calm. Even off Cape Hatteras, most
famed of weather-breeders, the sky was like turquoise
and the sea like glass. On the second day
out Roy was delighted to discover a school of
porpoises off the port bow. He had never seen
porpoises before, but had often read about these
huge playful fish-like creatures; and when he saw
them leaping out of the water, one after another,
like so many runners clearing hurdles, he knew
at once what they were. To his delight they came
close to the ship, and for a long time swam ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of it, as though towing the great vessel. Roy
knew that the <em>Lycoming</em> was making at least fifteen
knots an hour or better than a mile in four
minutes. Yet these big creatures kept pace with
her with no apparent effort; and when finally
they swam off, they darted away from the <em>Lycoming</em>
as though she were anchored.</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Roy. “If we’re going
fifteen knots an hour, how fast are those fellows
moving now?”</p>

<p>As the steamer drew into southern waters, the
gray-green color of the ocean took on a bluish
tint. Long before the ship entered the Gulf of
Mexico the water was of the most beautiful deep
blue, the color being emphasized by little whitecaps.
Along the Florida coast the steamer drew
so close to shore that Roy could distinctly see the
wide beaches, with their crowds of bathers and
the many automobiles rushing over the smooth
sands. Distinctly he could make out palm-trees
and other growths new and wonderful to him.
Often he watched the water in the hope that he
might discover a manatee, but those strange
animals frequent shallow waters and Roy saw
none of them.</p>

<p>On the way down the coast there was little for
Roy to do. Occasional messages came for the
captain; passengers sent messages infrequently;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and Roy regularly caught the weather signals and
picked from the air the nightly news-letter as
long as his instruments could catch the ever
fainter pulsations in the ether. These he continued
to send to the captain by messenger. Before
the journey ended, the <em>Lycoming</em> had passed
out of range of the transmitting instrument.
After that Roy had only the weather-report to
send.</p>

<p>The first time this occurred, the captain’s
steward appeared at the wireless house and soon
struck up a conversation with Roy. Casually he
asked for the daily news-letter. Roy guessed
that he had been sent by the captain expressly for
this news-letter. But if that were true, the captain
gave no evidence of the fact. He continued
to ignore Roy and gave no indication of any interest
in Roy’s work. To all outward appearances
he was merely tolerating Roy’s presence on
board because he was compelled to do so. And
Roy could see no way to gain the captain’s favor.</p>

<p>After a quick and uneventful run across the
Gulf, the Texas coast was sighted, and five days
after leaving New York the <em>Lycoming</em> was off
the port of Galveston.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WHERE COTTON IS KING</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Like Mount Zion, this great seaport was
beautiful for situation. Located on the
eastern tip of an island some thirty miles long,
that lay not far off the mainland and parallel
with it, the little city sat snugly between the Galveston
Bay on the north and the swelling waters
of the Gulf on the south. Barren stretches of
sand girt the city on the west, while farther along
the coast of the island rose some mound-like
structures above which flew the American flag.
Roy had already learned that this was Fort
Crockett. But of the city before him he knew
practically nothing.</p>

<p>After standing straight in toward land for a
considerable distance, the ship turned to port and,
like a match about to pass a sawlog, steamed
directly toward the island, but slightly to the
right or north of it. It was mid-forenoon and
there was no wireless work for Roy to do at the
time. He came out of the wireless house and
stood on the upper deck, so as to obtain an unobstructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
view. Captain Lansford was again
on the bridge. On the lower decks passengers
were saying good-bye to one another, and making
all the preparations necessary for departure.
Stewards were bustling about, looking after
baggage, helping passengers with their slight
wraps and hand luggage, and performing a
multitude of other acts designed in part to be
helpful, but meant mostly to draw forth generous
tips from grateful travelers. Much of this was
hidden from Roy. But he could see enough of
it to understand what was afoot. He was glad
he was by himself, where he did not have to watch
it. The very idea of seeking and taking tips was
repugnant to him.</p>

<p>He paid slight heed to what was going on below
him, however, for there was so much to see
elsewhere that he was soon deeply engrossed in
the scene before him. So deeply did he become
interested that he even failed to hear a footstep
on the ladder and was not conscious that any one
had mounted to his deck until a voice sounded
close to his ear. Roy turned about with a start,
then smiled a welcome. It was the chief engineer
whose duties, like Roy’s, were about ended
for the journey.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Anderson,” smiled Roy.
“I’m glad to see you. What brings you up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
here? Can I do anything for you? Any messages
you want sent?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Mercer,” said the chief engineer.
“I can’t think of a soul I want to communicate
with. The purser asked me to step up
and tell you about some of the things we shall
see. He knew that you would be interested in
them, but you know this is his busy time. He’s
up to his eyes in work just now.”</p>

<p>“I am obliged both to you and to the purser,”
said Roy. “I do want to know about Galveston,
but I don’t want to impose upon you, Mr. Anderson.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. It’s no imposition. You
know I am an engineer and I never tire of talking
of some of the engineering feats that have
been accomplished here. There is nothing in all
the world more interesting from an engineering
standpoint than some of the things that have been
done right on this little island.”</p>

<p>Roy opened his eyes wide. He had no idea
that Galveston was anything but a sleepy, southern
seaport. He decided not to display his
ignorance and so said nothing. But he felt sure
that after what he had seen in New York, Galveston
must prove to be tame indeed.</p>

<p>For a space the two stood shoulder to shoulder,
surveying the scene in silence. The usual morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
breeze had sprung up and the blue waters of
the Gulf were foaming white under its breath.
The whitecaps chased one another shoreward, and
broke on the beach in glistening foam. High
above them rose the town, looking for all the
world like a city built on a rock. Its white houses
gleamed in the warm June sun.</p>

<p>Roy soon forgot the still-distant city in his
astonishment at seeing what looked like a gigantic
stone wall that seemed to reach straight out from
the shore almost to the <em>Lycoming</em>. It made Roy
think of some of the old stone pasture walls on
the farms about his home. But this, being in the
sea, couldn’t possibly be a pasture wall, and Roy
had no idea what it was. On the end of it stood
a strong little structure that evidently held a light
to guide the way at night.</p>

<p>“What in the world is that curious stone wall
for?” asked Roy, turning to Mr. Anderson.</p>

<p>“I thought that you would soon find something
of interest,” said the chief engineer with a
smile. “That is one of the jetties Uncle Sam
built to deepen the channel. If you look off to
the right you will see a second jetty that roughly
parallels this. The jetty on the left is nearly
seven miles long. The one on the right is five
miles long. That makes twelve miles of stone
wall, as you call it. The two walls are two miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
apart at the shore end and seven thousand feet
at this end. We run in between them.”</p>

<p>“Makes you think of a pasture lane fenced in
with stone, doesn’t it?” inquired Roy with a
smile. “But how in the world can two stone
walls have anything to do with making the
channel deeper?”</p>

<p>Smiling over Roy’s perplexity, Mr. Anderson
replied, “That’s exactly what these jetties are,
in fact&mdash;a kind of lane for the waves to go
through. There are two bars that obstruct the
entrance to this harbor, which otherwise is one of
the finest in the land. Over the outer bar there
were only twelve feet of water, and at the inner
bar nine and a half feet. An ocean liner draws
twenty-five or thirty feet, you know, and couldn’t
possibly get over such a shallow place. That
meant that Galveston, though ideally situated for
a seaport, could never be reached by big ships.
The government kept dredging the channel, but
the shoals filled up about as fast as the dredges
dug them out. Finally Uncle Sam’s engineers
solved the problem by building those big stone
walls.”</p>

<p>“Even now I don’t understand what the stone
walls have to do with deepening the channel,”
said Roy, still perplexed.</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson chuckled. “Those stones, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
you call them, are granite blocks weighing five
to twelve tons each,” he said. “The jetties are
twelve to fifteen feet wide at the top and so solid
that the water can’t flow through them; so it has
to run between them, exactly like cattle going
down your pasture lane. The tide runs so fast
that it washes the loose sand out of the channel,
scouring it clean every day, as it were. The result
is that now Galveston has a thirty-one-foot
channel at high water.”</p>

<p>Roy whistled in astonishment. “That beats
anything I ever heard of,” he said. “It was a
pretty slick idea, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>Steadily the <em>Lycoming</em> ploughed her way along
between the jetties. As they drew near the
shore ends of the jetties, Roy noticed that the
long south jetty ran directly to Galveston Island,
while the shorter north jetty ended at a small
island in Galveston Bay. Mr. Anderson said it
was called Pelican Island.</p>

<p>But what immediately gripped Roy’s attention
was the great wall that began at the end of the
south jetty and ran around the outer side of the
city. Vaguely he remembered having heard of
the Galveston sea-wall, and he knew this must
be it. He was amazed as he looked at it. Evidently
the wall was of cement, for it appeared
like a solid piece of stone. Its seaward side was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
concave, being far wider at the base than at the
top. Its base was protected by a wide riprap of
huge granite blocks, evidently intended to prevent
the waves from undermining it. Roy wondered
how the waves could ever get up to the
wall, let alone threaten it, for a stretch of beach,
fully two hundred feet wide, lay between the wall
and the waves that were now breaking on the
glistening sands.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of it?” inquired the
chief engineer after a time.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of the Galveston sea-wall,” said
Roy, “but I had no idea it was anything like that.
Why, that’s a wonderful piece of work.”</p>

<p>“It’s a great deal more wonderful than you
think, Mr. Mercer. It is one of the most wonderful
things in the world. That wall is built on
sand.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Roy, not appreciating exactly
what a difference that meant.</p>

<p>“Yes; on <em>sand</em>,” repeated Mr. Anderson, with
considerable emphasis on the word. “You know
a heavy sea would ordinarily quickly undermine
such a structure. The sand would be washed
from underneath it.”</p>

<p>“Then what prevents the sea from doing it?”
asked Roy, growing much interested.</p>

<p>“It’s built on pilings,” replied the chief engineer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
“Four rows of ’em driven forty-three
feet into the sand and projecting a foot up into
the wall itself. Then there’s a twenty-four-foot
sheet piling behind the outer row to prevent
scouring, and the stone riprap at the foot of the
wall is twenty-seven feet wide and three feet
thick. The wall itself is sixteen feet thick at the
base, five feet wide at the top, and seventeen feet
high. The city built three and a half miles of it,
and the government extended it more than a mile
farther to protect Fort Crockett.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” ejaculated Roy. “That is some
piece of engineering. I don’t wonder you like to
look at it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! That’s only part of the story,” continued
the chief engineer with a smile, “and perhaps
the smaller part. The raising of the city
to the level of the wall is perhaps more wonderful
than the making of the wall itself. Sea-walls
aren’t unique by any means, but I know of nothing
quite like the raising of the level of Galveston.
You know the entire city was raised.”</p>

<p>Roy looked his astonishment. “Not really?”
he gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes, really. Before the storm of 1900 the
highest point in the city was only six feet above
tide level. Now it is nineteen feet. After the
sea-wall was done, they raised all the buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and the street-car tracks, built elevated plank
sidewalks, dredged twenty million cubic yards of
sand from the Gulf and pumped it into the city
until it filled up to the proper level. Then they
rebuilt foundations, repaved the streets, replanted
the trees and shrubs, and resowed the grass.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” exclaimed Roy. “I never heard
of anything like it. Why, it’s wonderful, wonderful!
I thought New York was great, but this
beats anything I saw there. Just to think of raising
a whole city nineteen feet in the air! Why,
that’s as high as a two-story house.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t quite so wonderful as that,” smiled
Mr. Anderson. “The nineteen-foot elevation is
only on the Gulf side. That point is two hundred
feet back from the sea-wall, so that if any
water comes over the wall it will run back into
the sea. In the other direction the ground slopes
toward the Bay, where they raised the level only
to eight feet. As the island is about three and
a half miles wide, that makes only a very slight
grade.”</p>

<p>For some time Roy stood in silent wonder.
He was amazed at what the chief engineer had
told him. Suddenly he turned to his companion
and demanded, “What did they do it for?
They’ll probably never have another storm like
that. Why, it must have cost a pile of money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“It cost millions,” said Mr. Anderson. “But
it was worth it. The flood of September 8, 1900,
swept over the city to a depth of sixteen feet.
People used to live way out this side of the sea-wall,
where now you see only tossing water.
The entire end of the island for eight blocks inland
was washed away, with all the houses.
Eight or ten thousand people were drowned and
the property loss was many millions. It was the
worst catastrophe due to natural causes in the history
of America. As for storms, you never can
tell. Every fall brings hard ones here in the
Gulf. They’ve had some bad ones besides the
Galveston flood. In September, 1875, a terrible
hurricane swept the city. Late in August, 1886,
another awful storm occurred. But the storm of
1900 was the worst ever known. There was a
tidal wave then that swept right over the island.
If the city was to be safe, it had to be protected
somehow. So they built the sea-wall. Such a
wave might occur again at any time. You might
see one yourself this coming September. There
are always bad storms then.”</p>

<p>By this time the <em>Lycoming</em> was close to her
dock and Roy was more than astonished at what
he could see of the shipping facilities.</p>

<p>“Whew!” he said. “It looks as though they
could handle almost as many ships here as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
do in New York. I had no idea Galveston was
so much of a seaport. There must be miles of
wharves. What makes it such a great seaport,
anyway?”</p>

<p>“Some years Galveston ranks next to New
York in the volume of its shipping,” said the chief
engineer, “so that it claims to be the second most
important seaport in America. So much of our
cotton is shipped by way of Galveston that it is
the greatest cotton port in all the world. The
greatest cottonseed grinding plant in the world
is right on the water-front, where its products can
be put directly aboard ships. And the port
handles an enormous amount of tropical products
like bananas, coffee, sugar, lumber, and corn and
cattle from Mexico and Argentina. There are
probably sixty or seventy lines of steamboats that
run from here. Ships go direct from Galveston
to all the important ports in Europe, Asia, Latin
America, and Cuba. So you see they need vast
shipping facilities. There are six miles of
wharves here and more than one hundred great
ocean freighters can load or unload at one
time.”</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar!” ejaculated Roy. “This certainly
must be a great city. How big is it, anyway?”</p>

<p>“That’s the interesting thing about Galveston.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
It does all this business, but it’s really only a
small city. I doubt if there are more than fifty
thousand people here, and its total area is only
about fifteen square miles. You could put it in
one of New York’s pockets, so to speak. Yet it
is the leading seaside resort in the southwest and
more than a million pleasure-seekers visit Galveston
every year.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” said Roy. “They must be
hustlers if so few people can handle so much
traffic. It seemed to me it took almost five thousand
stevedores and truck drivers just to load the
<em>Lycoming</em>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson laughed. “They can handle
so much freight,” he said, “because everything is
built so as to facilitate the work.”</p>

<p>He pointed out some grain elevators beside the
wharf from which wheat was pouring through
great spouts directly into waiting steamships, and
he showed Roy water-front warehouses for steel
materials, broom-corn, cotton, and other products.</p>

<p>“We shall dock beside a cotton warehouse,”
said the chief engineer. “Step into the place
when you go ashore and take a look at it.”</p>

<p>By this time the <em>Lycoming</em> was close to her
berth. The chief engineer said good-bye and
scrambled down the ladder. Roy watched Captain
Lansford dock the steamer. He could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
but admire the skilful way in which the commander
laid the huge ship beside her pier as
though she were a mere foot-boat. Then Roy
came down to the lower decks and watched the
passengers swarm ashore. Presently he went
down the gangplank himself. He walked up
and down the wharf, which felt very strange indeed
because it did not move like the ship.</p>

<p>Presently he stepped into the cotton warehouse
the chief engineer had pointed out to him. Its
size amazed him. It was hundreds of yards long
and many wide. Seemingly it contained thousands
of huge bales of cotton, each weighing five
hundred pounds. On the landward side freight
trains were standing full of cotton. And the
floors of trains, warehouse, and wharf were on a
level, so that the cotton could be trucked direct
from freight-car to steamer in one handling.
Roy could not help contrasting this expeditious
way of handling freight with the cumbersome
system necessary in New York.</p>

<p>He was turning the matter over in his mind
when the superintendent of the warehouse came
along. Noticing Roy’s uniform, he stopped and
spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Fine morning, sir,” he said. “Belong on the
<em>Lycoming</em>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Roy politely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I think not,” said Roy. “I was
just admiring your warehouse.”</p>

<p>The superintendent’s face lighted up. “Ain’t
she a daisy?” he said. “One of the finest in the
world. Step in and look around.”</p>

<p>“My!” said Roy, “you’ve a lot of cotton
here.”</p>

<p>“A mere handful, my boy, a mere handful,”
repeated the superintendent. “Our cotton concentration
plants here can accommodate a million
bales, sir, a million bales. We’ve handled four
million bales in a year at this port, sir.”</p>

<p>Roy stepped across the warehouse to look at
the cotton cars, but his eye was instantly caught
by the long lines of car tracks that ran parallel
with the wharves. The superintendent noticed
his astonishment.</p>

<p>“There are more than seventy-five miles of
tracks abutting on our water-front,” he said, “so
you see we can handle a heap of stuff.”</p>

<p>Roy whistled in amazement. “How do trains
get here?” he asked. “This is an island, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It sure is an island,” replied the superintendent,
“but we are connected with the mainland
by a big causeway of reinforced concrete,
like the sea-wall. It’s two miles long, and has
three railroad tracks, a roadway for vehicles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a path for pedestrians. It cuts right across the
Bay from the island to Virginia Point on the
mainland. You can see it from here.” And the
obliging warehouseman showed Roy the huge
stone roadway spanning the Bay.</p>

<p>“Too bad it had to be built, isn’t it?” said
Roy. “It cuts your harbor in half, I suppose.
If it weren’t for that you could sail ships clear
around the island.”</p>

<p>“We can, anyway,” replied the superintendent.
“There’s a roller lift bridge spanning
the channel that lifts straight up to let ships pass
through.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” exclaimed Roy. “Is there
anything you folks haven’t done down here?”</p>

<p>The superintendent’s face glowed with pride.
“Yes; that’s a pretty fine causeway,” he said,
“but as an engineering feat there’s nothing in
Galveston more interesting than our water supply.
We get our drinking water from artesian
wells on the mainland, the water being carried
through huge pipes laid under the Bay.”</p>

<p>“You are certainly a wonderful lot of people,
you Galveston folks,” cried Roy.</p>

<p>Again the superintendent smiled with pleasure.
Then his face became serious. “We have done
a lot of interesting things here,” he said, “but we
aren’t a bit different from the rest of the nation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
We’re Americans. That explains all these up-to-date
achievements. They represent the spirit
of America. You’ll find Americans doing the
same kind of wonderful things wherever you go&mdash;New
York, or San Francisco, or here in Galveston.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad I’m an American,” said
Roy with emphasis.</p>

<p>“You ought to be, young man. Don’t ever
forget that.”</p>

<p>The superintendent went on about his duties
and Roy began to look about him again. He
wanted to see something of the city itself, but decided
to wait until the purser could go with him.</p>

<p>It was not until after luncheon that the purser
found time for a stroll with Roy. Then the two
set out for a tour of the city. As they came down
the gangplank, the harbor-master was passing.
Catching sight of the purser, he turned about and
hurried over to greet him.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Mr. Robbins, good-evening,”
he said heartily, shaking the purser’s hand
warmly. “I sure am glad to see you. You’ll
pardon me for hurrying away now, won’t you?
For I have a pressing job on hand. But won’t
you all stop at my office later? If I’m not there
you all find chairs on the gallery. Nathan will
look after you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks,” smiled the purser. “We’ll be delighted
to stop.”</p>

<p>He introduced Roy and the harbor-master
hurried away, again apologizing for leaving
them.</p>

<p>When the harbor-master was out of hearing,
Roy turned to the purser. “Did you notice that
he said ‘good-evening’ to us, and it’s only half-past
one?”</p>

<p>The purser laughed. “In the south,” he explained,
“evening begins at one minute after
noon. Nobody ever says good-afternoon down
here.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” exclaimed Roy. “And what
did he mean by ‘find a chair on the gallery’?”</p>

<p>“Gallery is the southern name for piazza or
portico,” said the purser.</p>

<p>“And did you notice how he said ‘you all’?
Does everybody talk like that down here?”</p>

<p>Again the purser laughed. “Unless he’s just
landed, like yourself, he does.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Roy, with a sigh, “I see one thing.
I’ve got to learn how to speak English all over
again or these folks won’t know what I’m talking
about. How does it come that southerners talk
so different from the rest of the country?”</p>

<p>“It’s easy to see that you’ve never traveled,”
replied the purser, “or you wouldn’t say that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
New Englanders don’t talk any more like New
Yorkers than New Yorkers talk like folks out
west.”</p>

<p>Roy’s eyes opened wide. “I never knew that,”
he said. “What’s the reason for it?”</p>

<p>“The size of the country,” said the purser.
“The United States of America is as big as half
a dozen countries of Europe rolled into one. We
don’t think it strange that people of different
nations speak different languages and it isn’t
any stranger that people in different sections of
such a vast country as the United States should
develop different dialects.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that before,” said Roy.</p>

<p>They passed on into the city. But though it
was midday very few persons were to be seen.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” queried Roy. “The
streets are almost deserted and there doesn’t seem
to be any business going on at all.”</p>

<p>Again the purser smiled. “Just another difference
in customs,” he said. “In England, you
know, all business stops for five o’clock tea.
Here it is the custom to rest during the middle
of the day. That’s a common practice in all hot
countries.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” cried Roy. “I’m certainly
learning a lot.”</p>

<p>They passed on into the city. The business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
houses were mostly low and old-fashioned. The
dwellings were mostly detached frame structures,
each standing in a yard full of flowers and
shrubbery. There was an almost utter absence
of large trees, but after what Roy had learned
about the grade raising he understood why there
were none. It astonished him to learn from the
purser that there never had been any real tall
trees, because the island was so near tide level
that the salt water seeping through the sand
killed all deep-rooted growths. What particularly
delighted Roy was the presence everywhere
of rich growths of oleanders, and other tropical
plants that he had never seen before.</p>

<p>“I feel almost as though I were in a foreign
country,” said Roy after a time. “It is all so
different from the north.”</p>

<p>“In a sense you are in a foreign land,” replied
the purser, “for Galveston hasn’t been a part of
the United States nearly as long as your native
Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t realize that,” said Roy. “How did
that happen?”</p>

<p>“You’ve evidently forgotten your history,
Roy. Galveston Island, and all of Texas, for
that matter, once belonged to Mexico, and Mexico
was ruled by Spain.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Roy, somewhat mortified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“This island,” continued the purser, “was
named after the Count de Galvez, the Spanish
viceroy of Mexico. In 1836 Colonel Michael
Menard organized the Galveston Company and
bought the island from the Republic of Texas for
$50,000, but the company didn’t prosper very
well. Later we fought Mexico and in 1848 acquired
all of Texas and other border states in the
southwest. After that date Galveston was a
sure enough part of the nation, but you see Uncle
Sam was a hale old gentleman of nearly seventy
years by that time. So Galveston has been a part
of the country only about half as long as the
territory in the original thirteen states.”</p>

<p>“It’s mighty interesting to think of the Spaniards
being here,” said Roy. “Reminds you of
pirates.”</p>

<p>“There were pirates here all right, but I do not
believe they were Spanish. Jean Lafitte was a
very notorious pirate, and in 1816 he made this
island his headquarters. Later he was driven out
by the United States government. What an
ideal place this was for him, with this fine bay to
hide in until unsuspecting ships came near. He
could probably get fresh meat here, too, for this
island was once a favorite hunting ground of the
Caronkawas, a powerful and warlike tribe of Indians
that lived along the Texas coast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The two continued straight on across the
island and finally found themselves on the Gulf
side. They stood on the broad sea-wall and
looked out over the great expanse of tossing
waves. Far as the eye could see nothing was
visible but shining water. Far below them the
waves broke on the sands and chased one another
up the sloping beach. High above the sands, on
great pilings, stood numerous pavilions and piers
built for the accommodation of pleasure-seekers.
Along the sea-wall ran a broad promenade of
asphalt, the water-front buildings standing a
hundred feet back from the sea-wall. There were
few bathers, but the purser said the beach would
be crowded later in the day.</p>

<p>From the Gulf beach the two sightseers made
their way back to the <em>Lycoming</em> by circuitous
routes, walking this way and that to see objects
of interest that the purser wanted to point out.
They saw some of the twenty magnificent hotels
that care for the floating population, including
the community hotel, The Galvez, that was built
by popular subscription. They took a look at
the United States Custom-house and other public
buildings, saw the great dry dock and marine
works, the clearing and conditioning elevator, the
creosoting plant, and a number of big factories
and warehouses. When they got back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
<em>Lycoming</em>, after stopping for a chat with the
harbor-master, Roy felt as though he had been
on a very long journey. He had seen more new
things and learned more than he believed possible
in one day.</p>

<p>But nothing pleased him more than the fact
that everybody treated him as though he were a
man. It was only a few days since people in
Central City had been shouting at him, “Hey,
kid!” Now every one addressed him as Mr.
Mercer and was very courteous to him&mdash;that is,
every one excepting Captain Lansford, who
hardly spoke to him at all and who seemed annoyed
every time he met him. Roy believed he
was doing his work well enough to deserve his
captain’s good-will. He had been absolutely
faithful and had spent much more time at his
post than the regulations required. But the captain
seemed to have no understanding of that
fact or appreciation of what he was doing.</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Roy, “one swallow doesn’t
make a summer, and one voyage doesn’t make an
experienced wireless man. The time will come
when the captain will be glad he’s got a wireless
man aboard. I’ll learn all I can and make myself
as useful as possible. My opportunity will
come.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THWARTING A WIRELESS INCENDIARY</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">There seemed small chance that his opportunity
would come while the <em>Lycoming</em> was
in port, however, for the great ship lay peacefully
in her dock, day after day, while the process
of loading her went on apace. There was almost
nothing for Roy to do. Though he had
seen a great deal on the day of his arrival, there
still remained many points of interest that he
wished to visit. But before doing any more
sightseeing, Roy determined to familiarize himself
with the <em>Lycoming</em>. He was working for
more than amusement. A chance might come,
even though he had nothing whatever to do with
navigating the ship, when a thorough knowledge
of the vessel might be of great use. So he decided
to stick to the ship for a time.</p>

<p>Roy was now in position to learn with ease
whatever he wished to know about the <em>Lycoming</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
He felt sure that both Mr. Young, the first mate,
and the chief engineer, Mr. Anderson, had taken
a fancy to him. As for the purser, Mr. Robbins,
Roy knew well enough that the latter was his
firm friend. Sam, the steward, had looked after
Roy with that genuine solicitude that only an old
southern darky can display, and Roy had already
grown fond of the white-headed negro. He knew
that these men would gladly show him any parts
of the ship he wished to see.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast on the morning
after their arrival, Roy slipped down to the purser’s
office. He intended merely to ask what was
the most interesting thing to see on shipboard.
But when he beheld the purser sweating at his
desk, with a mountainous pile of bills, receipts,
and other memoranda stacked around him, Roy
immediately made up his mind what he was going
to do.</p>

<p>“See here,” said Roy. “Isn’t there something
I can do to help you? I can add pretty
well and write a plain hand, and I’m looking for
a job.”</p>

<p>The purser looked at him quizzically. “Tired
of sightseeing already?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said Roy. “I’m going to
see everything in this town that’s worth seeing.
But you’re loaded down with work. I can see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
that. And if there’s anything I can do to help
you, I want to do it. The sightseeing can wait.
What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“If you really mean it,” said the purser, “you
can help me an awful lot. Just read these memoranda
to me while I check the entries in my
books.”</p>

<p>All that morning Roy and the purser worked
in the latter’s office. Roy read memoranda,
added figures, copied accounts, and did other
tasks as directed. For a while Mr. Robbins
checked up Roy’s work; but he soon found that
Roy was careful and made no mistakes. When
noon came the purser threw down his pen with a
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Lad,” he said, “it would have taken me two
days to do alone what the two of us have accomplished
this morning. This just about clears up
my work at this end of the trip. I can’t tell you
how I hate all this business of accounts or how
much obliged I am to you. I don’t know how to
thank you.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” protested Roy. “I haven’t done
anything. I ought to thank you for teaching me
something about a purser’s work. I want to
know all about steamships, now that I’m going to
live on one.”</p>

<p>“Good boy,” cried the purser. “I thought I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
wasn’t mistaken in you. I’ll back you to succeed,
Roy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll need a whole lot of backing,” laughed
Roy, “if I am ever to get anywhere with Captain
Lansford. He sure has it in for me.”</p>

<p>“Just forget about him and keep on plugging,”
said the purser. “You’ll swear by him
when you know him better.”</p>

<p>Roy made a wry face.</p>

<p>“Come on, lad,” suggested the purser, pulling
on his coat. “No old ship’s grub for us to-day.
We’ll have a bite of real southern cooking.”</p>

<p>He hooked his arm in Roy’s and they hustled
up the gangplank and down the wharf toward a
near-by restaurant, where they had chicken
gumbo soup, fried chicken, hot corn bread, Mexican
coffee, so strong it almost made Roy sick,
and a number of other dishes that were strange
and wonderful to Roy.</p>

<p>The purser was feeling very complacent by the
time they returned to the ship.</p>

<p>“What do we do next?” asked Roy. “I’m
eager to learn some more about a purser’s work.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to tackle a little job that is always
part of this purser’s business when he is in
Galveston, and that will be as interesting to you,
I suspect, as it is new.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward and punched the call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
bell. In a few moments Sam, the steward, appeared.</p>

<p>“What can I do for yuh, Mistah Robbins,
suh?” he inquired, bowing and smiling.</p>

<p>“You know that little job I always do down
here with a pound of white meat, Sam?”</p>

<p>“’Deed I does, suh,” chuckled the darky,
grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p>“Well, then you know what to do, Sam. I
want you to fix us up in your very best style.
Mr. Mercer has never dangled a bit of white
meat.”</p>

<p>Sam went out, chuckling aloud, and Roy was
too astonished for words. He didn’t like to ask
questions, for the purser had once admonished
him to keep his eyes open and his mouth shut if
he wished to get ahead in the world; so he waited
for the purser to explain. But Mr. Robbins gave
him no hint of what to expect. All he said was,
“We’ll just check off this last list while Sam is
getting us ready.” But Roy could see that the
purser’s eyes were dancing.</p>

<p>Before they were done with the check-list, Sam
reappeared. He had two large chunks of whitish
meat, each piece weighing a pound or more, and
each being attached to a long length of strong
cord.</p>

<p>The purser threw down the list they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
checking. “Come on,” he said, and picking up
the two pieces of meat, he led the way on deck.
A yawl was bobbing alongside the <em>Lycoming</em> and
a rope ladder had been let down to it. In the
yawl lay two scoop nets. Mr. Robbins dropped
the meat into the yawl, then led the way down the
ladder.</p>

<p>“Now lower your meat into the water until it
is completely out of sight,” said the purser, when
the two had seated themselves at opposite ends
of the little boat. “When you feel something
nibbling at your bait, pull up very slowly and
gently. So.” And he dropped his meat into
the water, then carefully raised it.</p>

<p>Roy did as directed, and sat very still, holding
the line over his forefinger. The current tugged
at his bait and deceived him at first and he lifted
his meat in vain. But presently he felt a very
different sort of pull on his cord. Drawing it
upward ever so gently, the white meat presently
came in sight and hanging to it with its two claws
was a greenish-blue creature with a number of
flippers gently waving in the water.</p>

<p>“Easy now,” urged the purser. “Scoop him
gently or you’ll lose him. He’s a big one.” And
he thrust one of the nets into Roy’s hand.</p>

<p>But Roy was too eager. He made a little
splash as he dipped the net, and the creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
sank from sight. Roy made a vigorous scoop
with the net, but missed it.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Roy. “That was a fool
trick. I’ll bet I don’t scare the next one away.”</p>

<p>Nor did he. The purser lifted and netted one
of the creatures while Roy was speaking, and
dropped it in the bottom of the boat. But before
Roy had time to look at it, he felt another tug at
his line. Gently lifting his bait, he discovered
another of the creatures nibbling at it. This one
was a whopper. Taking great care, Roy netted
the thing and dropped it in the boat with an exclamation
of triumph.</p>

<p>“They look exactly like crabs,” said Roy,
“only they are green instead of red.”</p>

<p>The purser burst into a roar of laughter, and
over his head Roy heard suppressed titterings.
He looked up and saw several of the stewards, including
Sam, watching them.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, old fellow,” said the purser after
a moment, wiping his eyes with his handkerchief.
“I just couldn’t help laughing. They are crabs,
all right enough. Those you are evidently
familiar with have been boiled. These will be
red, too, when they are cooked. Boiling changes
their color.”</p>

<p>Roy laughed heartily at his own mistake. “I
don’t wonder they turn red when they’re boiled,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
he said. “I believe I should, too. And I don’t
wonder you laughed at me.”</p>

<p>“I’m heartily ashamed of myself,” said the
purser, now sober enough, “but I just couldn’t
help it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that,” smiled Roy.
“I should have laughed harder than you did if
I had been in your place.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Roy,” rejoined the purser.
“Anybody who can laugh at a joke when it’s on
himself, will get along all right.”</p>

<p>In a short time they had caught a fine mess of
crabs and the creatures were crawling all over the
bottom of the boat. Roy tried to pick one of
them up, but the crab nipped his fingers with its
claws until the blood came.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” exclaimed Roy. “They sure
can pinch.”</p>

<p>“Let me show you how to handle them,” suggested
the purser. And selecting the largest and
fiercest looking crab in the boat, he deftly caught
it from behind and picked it up. The creature
tried in vain to pinch the purser’s fingers but
could not reach them. Imitating the purser,
Roy safely picked up a crab and soon was holding
one aloft in each hand.</p>

<p>“Sam,” said the purser, dropping his meat
into the bottom of the boat, “see what you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
do with these fellows. And remember, Mr.
Mercer has never eaten fresh crabs.”</p>

<p>When the two fishermen had climbed to the
deck of the <em>Lycoming</em> and Sam had taken charge
of the crabs, the purser said to Roy, “Now run
along and enjoy yourself. I’m a thousand times
obliged to you for your help.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there anything more that I can do to
help you?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Not a thing, lad. One can finish what remains
as well as two, and perhaps better than
two. But I’m obliged to you for the offer.”</p>

<p>“I’m obliged to you for the dinner and the
introduction to real, live crabs,” said Roy as he
turned away from the purser and found himself
face to face with the chief engineer.</p>

<p>“Well, did you enjoy yourself?” asked Mr.
Anderson, with a smile. “I saw you crabbing
with Mr. Robbins.”</p>

<p>“I had a fine time,” answered Roy. “It was
my first experience at catching crabs.”</p>

<p>“You’re seeing lots of new things, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, and they are all interesting.
Sometime I hope you will be willing to show me
your engines.”</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson’s face lighted up like a child’s.
“Would you really like to see them?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Indeed I would, Mr. Anderson. I want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
learn everything I can about ships. Sometime I
may be able to make use of the knowledge.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to get ahead in the world,”
commented the chief engineer. “Learn all you
can about everything. If you are not busy now,
I’ll be happy to show you the engine room. It’s
always a pleasure to show things to people when
they are interested.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Anderson. I shall be glad
indeed to see the engine room.”</p>

<p>They went down into the interior of the ship.
“These are the coal-bunkers,” said the chief engineer,
showing Roy the rows of compartments
where the coal was kept and explaining how it
was carried to the fire-room by coal-passers.
The fire-room itself seemed like a furnace to Roy,
but Mr. Anderson said it was quite cool, for some
of the fires had been drawn altogether and most
of those still burning were banked.</p>

<p>“If you want to know what heat is,” said Mr.
Anderson, “you must come down here sometime
when we’re making maximum steam pressure.
Then every one of these furnaces is roaring
hot. At that time the only air that gets into
the fire-room comes down through the ventilators
and goes up through the furnace. That’s what
we call forced draught. It keeps the firemen busy
then to feed the fires and rake the grates clear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
clinkers. You can see what beds of coals they
have to tend.”</p>

<p>He threw open a furnace door. Even with
the fire burning low, the wave of heat seemed
stifling to Roy.</p>

<p>“How can they ever stand it to work in such
heat?” asked Roy. “The temperature must be
terrible here when all your fires are roaring.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it gets pretty hot. I suppose the thermometer
touches 150 or 160 degrees at times.
The men wear thick woolen shirts to protect them
from the heat. But even so they can’t stand it
very long at a stretch. They work in four-hour
shifts.”</p>

<p>With great interest Roy looked at the huge
boilers and all the shining machinery. He had
no idea it required such a great lot of engines to
run a steamship.</p>

<p>“It’s mighty interesting,” said Roy, when
they had completed their inspection, “and I am
very much obliged to you for showing this to me.
Sometime I want to come down when all your
fires are going. I’m glad I have seen it all, for
now it will mean more to me when the ship is at
sea. I’ll think of you fellows sweating away
down here in order that the ship may sail safely.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll think of you, way up in your perch,
keeping watch and calling help if we need it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
It’s a great comfort to know that the <em>Lycoming</em>
is equipped with wireless. The old boat we used
to run on had no wireless, and many’s the storm
I’ve been through when I thought my last minute
was near. I tell you we have some rough weather
down here in the Gulf.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Roy ruefully, “I’m glad you
don’t agree with the captain about wireless. It’s
rather discouraging to work in such circumstances.
It will help me to do good work to
think about you fellows down in the engine room.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Mr. Anderson, “it takes a
good many men to run a big ship, and every one
has to do his work well if the ship is to be safe.
But when you think of the rest of us, don’t forget
that the captain is working for you just as
hard as the rest of us, and perhaps harder. You
mustn’t let your differences with the skipper
blind you to his worth. He’s a great sailor.
Some day you’ll admire him as much as the rest
of us do. Good-bye. Come again.”</p>

<p>Roy spent many hours watching the unloading
of the ship. It was interesting to see the big
boom draw over the open hatch and the great
netfuls of freight come slowly up out of the hold
and swing over the ship’s side and down to the
wharf. But eventually the scene lost its charm,
and Roy was glad enough when the purser came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
along one morning and invited him to take a walk
along the water-front. They visited a number
of ships, and Roy saw several that he had read
about in the newspapers. Everybody seemed
glad to see the purser, and Roy did not wonder
that he had so many friends. They went aboard
one of the big ships of the Ward Line, and the
purser made Roy known to the wireless man and
some of the officers, as he had done on each ship.</p>

<p>“You came down just a lap behind us,” said
the wireless man, whose name was Reynolds,
“and you’ll be only a few hours behind us going
back. I’ll give you a call once in a while and let
you know what sort of weather is ahead of you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Roy. “That will be fine.”</p>

<p>“You should have arrived a day sooner,” said
Mr. Reynolds, turning to the purser. “The
<em>Empress</em> left just twelve hours before you came
in.” And then to Roy he added, “Stimson is
wireless man on the <em>Empress</em>. He’s a bully good
fellow, and you’ll like him.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed the purser. “The captain
will be sorry to hear that. Funny about
those two men, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The wireless man nodded and the purser
turned to Roy, who was wondering what he
meant.</p>

<p>“You know the captain’s brother is in command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the <em>Empress</em>,” he explained. “She runs
to Cuba and South America. The two men have
been sailing to this port for a long time, but they
haven’t seen each other in ten years. They always
seem to miss each other. Their schedules
just don’t quite overlap, and both are such blame
good sailors they’re always on schedule.”</p>

<p>“You bet they’re good sailors,” said Mr.
Reynolds with emphasis. “You’re a lucky fellow
to start your life afloat with such a commander
as Captain John Lansford. He’s easily
the best commander your line possesses, and I
rate him as the best sailing into Galveston. He
wouldn’t be commodore of the Confederated
Lines if he weren’t a crackerjack, you can bet,
and he wouldn’t be in charge of their newest and
finest boat. But his brother is a close second.”</p>

<p>Roy made no reply. He had no idea his commander
ranked so high. Presently they said
good-bye to Mr. Reynolds and continued on up
the water-front. They visited a number of great
warehouses, had a look inside a grain elevator,
and went aboard several more ships. Altogether
Roy met eight or ten wireless operators. He felt
grateful to the purser for making him acquainted
with these men. He foresaw that it would make
his work much more pleasant. When they came
back to the ship the day was almost ended. Roy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
noticed that the big boom was no longer working,
but had been made fast again. Evidently the
ship was unloaded. Next day they would begin
to take on cargo. Excepting for a few small
shipments of stuff from Mexican ports, the cargo
would consist almost wholly of cotton.</p>

<p>The instant Roy set eyes on his commander
the next morning, he knew something was wrong.
From the purser he soon learned that the cotton
train that was bringing the <em>Lycoming</em>’s cargo
had been wrecked, and would be many hours late,
if not indeed whole days behind time. There
was considerable cotton in the warehouse, but
nowhere nearly enough to fill the <em>Lycoming’s</em>
capacious holds.</p>

<p>The Mexican stuff was put aboard first.
There were logs of mahogany, bags of coffee,
bundles of crude rubber, quantities of cocoanuts,
and bales of hemp. These were stowed in the
very nose of the ship. Then the colored roustabouts
began to load the cotton.</p>

<p>Roy had been astonished at the work done by
the stevedores in New York. He was simply
amazed at the herculean labors of the dusky
cotton handlers. From the far end of the great
warehouse, they came trundling the huge cotton
bales, each weighing approximately five hundred
pounds, on their little barrel trucks. But what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
astonished Roy was the way they shot their great
loads into the ship’s hold. The tide was at ebb,
and the <em>Lycoming’s</em> open ports were far below
the level of the wharf. Down a steep gangway
cut into the pier itself went the roustabouts, one
behind another in a constant stream, each riding
the handles of his truck to lessen the speed as his
heavy load fairly shot down the incline. By the
time the truck plunged through the open port its
momentum was terrific. Yet the roustabout regained
his footing, and guided the fast-moving
truck to one side with incredible skill, often turning
it at a sharp angle. For a long time Roy
watched the ceaseless procession of cotton bales
shoot into the <em>Lycoming’s</em> hold. At first he
hardly breathed for fear a truck would upset as
it made the sharp turn, and those behind it come
crashing into it, probably mutilating, if not killing
outright, the roustabouts that guided them.
But truck after truck came plunging down, one
close behind another, while the returning freight
handlers as ceaselessly pushed their empty trucks
up the other side of the gangway. It seemed to
Roy that an accident <em>must</em> happen. Yet minute
after minute passed and the procession of cotton
bales continued without interruption.</p>

<p>For an hour Roy watched the roustabouts, his
wonder at their strength and skill increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
minute by minute. Finally he decided that he
would ask Mr. Young to show him the wheel-house
and the officers’ quarters. He had hardly
reached the main stairway, however, before a
revenue officer came bustling aboard and demanded
to see the <em>Lycoming’s</em> commander.
Sam, the steward, carried the officer’s message up
to the captain’s cabin, and a moment later Captain
Lansford came striding down the stairway.</p>

<p>The revenue officer greeted him with great
politeness. “I’m sorry to tell you, Captain
Lansford,” he said, “that we are in receipt of a
tip that a quantity of whiskey has been smuggled
into this port from Mexico in bales of hemp. I
have traced the bales and find they have been
loaded aboard the <em>Lycoming</em>. I’m sorry, sir,
but I’ll have to examine those bales.”</p>

<p>The captain gave an exclamation of disgust.
“Where are those bales stowed?” he asked, turning
to the officer in charge of loading.</p>

<p>“Forrard, sir, in the very nose of the ship.”</p>

<p>“Can we get at them easily?”</p>

<p>“There are a few hundred bales of cotton piled
on top of them and behind them.”</p>

<p>“The dickens!” snorted the captain. “Get
’em out, and be quick about it.”</p>

<p>Instantly word was passed to the roustabouts
to stop loading and take their trucks into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
hold. But the roustabouts could not shift the
cargo fast enough to suit Captain Lansford.</p>

<p>“Get your donkey-engine ready to hoist those
hemp bales out,” he ordered.</p>

<p>The engine had been stowed forward. Skids
were put under it, the engine was shifted into
position, the belt slipped on, and the foremast
derrick-boom unlashed and coupled up with the
engine.</p>

<p>Meantime the roustabouts had been taking the
cotton bales from the nose of the ship and trucking
them aft of the forward hatch, where they
dumped them down without order. The result
was that the forward hold speedily filled and the
cotton began to pile up under the hatchway.</p>

<p>When Captain Lansford noticed it he exploded
with anger. “Get those bales out of
that,” he shouted at the roustabouts. “We want
the hatchway clear for hoisting.”</p>

<p>Not all the cotton had yet been removed from
the forehold and the way aft was blocked by the
cotton that had been thrown helter-skelter by the
roustabouts.</p>

<p>“Start your engine,” called the captain, “and
jerk some of those bales out on deck.”</p>

<p>The donkey-engine was started and bale after
bale lifted to the deck, while the roustabouts below
were struggling desperately to shift the bales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
away from the hatchway. In the haste the cotton
was handled recklessly. Some of the metal bale
straps were broken, the white, snowy contents
bulging out of the sacking like pop-corn swelling
out of an overfilled popper. But finally all the
cotton was got out of the road. The deck about
the hatchway was piled high with it, and the hold
near the hatch was heaped with disorderly piles
of it.</p>

<p>Next the bales of hemp were trucked to the
hatchway and hoisted, one by one, to the deck.
Eagerly the revenue officer attacked them, cutting
bands, tearing out handfuls of the long, dry
fibres, and probing in the hearts of the bales.
Soon the deck was littered with loose hemp fibres
and wads of cotton, that the stiff breeze blew
about in little clouds. Bale after bale was torn
open, but though he searched every bale, the
revenue officer found no smuggled whiskey. In
great mortification he apologized to the captain
for his interference with loading operations.
Roy was surprised at the captain’s reply.</p>

<p>“You were merely doing your duty,” he said,
“and no apologies are necessary. Have a cigar&mdash;a
real Havana&mdash;sent me by my brother&mdash;and not
smuggled, sir.” And the captain opened his cigar
case and extended it to his visitor.</p>

<p>“Well, wouldn’t that jar you?” said Roy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
himself. “I expected to see some fireworks and
here he hands the revenue man a good cigar. I
noticed one thing. He said it was all right because
the man was doing his duty. Maybe there’s
hope for me after all.”</p>

<p>The revenue officer went away. Captain
Lansford ordered the cargo stowed again and
went to his quarters. Mr. Young took charge,
and soon the roustabouts were putting the ship
to rights again. Roy lingered to watch them.</p>

<p>First of all the hemp bales had to go back in
place. Cords were brought and the bales tied up
in the best way possible. But it was not practicable
to replace the torn-out fibres. One by
one the hemp bales were lowered into the hold.
The cotton bales followed. Roy noticed that
when these great quarter-ton packages rose
above the deck they climbed aloft jerkily and he
saw that the belt on the donkey-engine was
slipping badly. For several minutes he watched,
then walked over to the donkey-engine to see
what was wrong. Cotton bales were piled all
about and he had to edge his way between them
and the whirling belt. Suddenly the wind lifted
his hat. He grabbed for it, then jumped back as
though he had been jabbed with a pin.</p>

<p>“I must have been scraped by the moving
belt,” thought Roy. But a second later he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
muttered, “Why, a belt couldn’t have felt like
that through my clothes! Wonder what it was.”</p>

<p>Curious, he again pressed close to the belt and
again something stung him.</p>

<p>“Electricity,” thought Roy. “That slipping
belt is generating electricity.”</p>

<p>Then he thought of the cotton. A glance
showed him a ragged bale with a metal strap
broken in two places, and one jagged end swaying
close to the moving belt. Across the bale,
and lying fairly on the broken metal band, rested
a chain that had been flung there to clear the
deck. Its lower end dangled across the metal
frame of the hatchway. The thought of fire
flashed through Roy’s head. A spark leaping to
the broken band as it had leaped to his body,
might ignite the ragged bale. The litter of
cotton and hemp fibre, swirling in the wind and
falling through the hatchway, would carry the
flames like tinder to the heart of the ship.</p>

<p>“Mr. Young,” shouted Roy. “Get that bale
away quick!”</p>

<p>But even as he spoke a spark leaped across the
break in the bale strap. A second spark might
fire the bale. There was no time for words.
Roy leaped to the belt and frantically tore it
loose. The donkey-engine began to race at terrible
speed. The bale in mid-air came tumbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
down on the heaped-up cotton, bounced to the
deck, and landed fairly against the racing donkey-engine.
With a crash that jarred the ship the
engine overturned. Snap! went the piston-rod.
Then the machine lay still.</p>

<p>Roy was aghast. He turned to the first officer
to explain. The captain, aroused by the
noise, came running down the stairway. His
face grew black as he surveyed the ruin.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” he demanded, turning
to Mr. Young.</p>

<p>But before the first officer could speak, Roy
stepped in front of the captain.</p>

<p>“I did it to prevent fire, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>The captain exploded with wrath. “What
do you mean by interfering with the operation of
the ship?” he said fiercely. “If there was danger
of fire, why didn’t you notify the officer in
charge?”</p>

<p>“I did try to, sir, but there wasn’t time. The
belt was generating electricity and the broken
bale strap was already charged with it. I saw
one spark, and if I hadn’t thrown the belt off the
engine the cotton might have been afire in a second.
With all this litter on deck, the wind blowing
so hard, and the hatchway open, the ship
might have burned. I’m sorry I broke the engine,
sir, but I acted to save the ship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“All nonsense. Who ever heard of a donkey-engine
belt making sparks. Don’t you ever dare
to interfere with operations on shipboard again.
Go to your quarters. And in future try to control
your imagination.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A LESSON IN DIPLOMACY</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">A few minutes later the purser stepped
quietly into the wireless house. Roy sat
before his operating table, his head bowed on his
extended arms.</p>

<p>“Cheer up!” called the purser. “This won’t
do at all. Tell me what has happened.”</p>

<p>Roy recounted the entire incident. As the
recital continued, the purser’s face became as
sober as Roy’s had been.</p>

<p>“I don’t know a thing about electricity,” he
commented, when Roy had concluded his brief
description of what had occurred. “Are you
very sure that you are correct?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely, Mr. Robbins. You see, the belt
on the donkey-engine was slipping. I noticed
that at the start. The slipping of the belt produced
undue friction and that, in turn, developed
frictional or static electricity. The more
the belt slipped, the more it became charged with
electricity. Finally the belt became so highly
charged that the electricity jumped to the swaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
end of the broken bale strap. This bale strap
was broken into two pieces. The end swaying
caught the charge as it leaped from the belt and
a second spark occurred when the charge leaped
the other gap in the strap. This last part of the
strap was grounded by the chain that ran down
to the metal frame of the ship. So there was a
perfect mechanism for making and discharging
electricity. As long as the belt continued to slip,
electricity would have been generated. And
every time the current was discharged, there
would have been a spark right in that loose cotton
where the bale was broken open.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know a thing about electricity, as I
told you. But if you say it was so, I have no
doubt it was.”</p>

<p>“It’s just like electricity in the skies,” explained
Roy. “You have often seen lightning,
Mr. Robbins. Lightning is only electricity
leaping from a cloud to the earth or to another
cloud. We usually have lightning in hot weather.
Then the heated air from the earth rushes upward
with such velocity that it generates electricity,
charging the clouds with it, just as that
whirling belt was charged by the friction of the
wheel. That electricity has to reach the earth.
When the potential is high enough, the current
leaps from the cloud to the earth and a spark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
occurs which we call lightning. Sparks are made
only when an electric current is interrupted in its
flow and has to jump a gap. Electricity is flowing
through a telegraph-wire all the time, but
there is no spark because there is no break in the
wire. But if the wire should be cut and the ends
held near together, the current would jump the
gap, making a spark as it leaped. That’s the
thing that makes it possible to have automobiles.
Electric currents run from the magneto, which
generates them, to the spark-plugs in the cylinders.
There the currents have to leap tiny gaps
and sparks result, which explode the gasoline
vapor. There are several ways to generate electricity,
but the current, once generated, always
follows the same laws. Yet I couldn’t make the
captain understand. In fact he wouldn’t give
me an opportunity to explain. I tried to do my
duty by the ship, and now I’m worse off than
ever. The captain will never have a bit of use
for me after this. I suppose I’ll not only lose
my berth at the end of my three months, but he’ll
make such an unfavorable report about me that
I’ll never have another chance.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that, Roy. Leave
it to me. I know the captain like a book and I
know how to fix things up. I don’t wonder you
feel as you do about Captain Lansford, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
you really know him, you’ll feel differently. He
has his peculiarities, like the rest of us, and one
of them is his utter hatred of what he terms newfangled
ideas. The greatest pride of his life is
the fact that in thirty years at sea he has never
lost a man or a ship. If some one can show him
that you probably saved his ship from destruction,
he’ll have a very different idea of both you
and wireless telegraphy.”</p>

<p>“But he won’t listen to any explanation,” said
Roy, mournfully.</p>

<p>“Leave that to me. I know how to fix him.
Meantime, continue to do your work as faithfully
as you know how. Forget that you are
working under Captain Lansford and remember
that you are working for the welfare of the <em>Lycoming</em>.
If you do that, you can’t fail in time to
win the captain’s good-will. That’s his test of
every soul aboard&mdash;whether or not they are working
for the good of the ship.</p>

<p>“When you threw off the engine belt and the
engine was broken, you hit the captain harder
than you understood. He has a wonderful
record for sailing on time. We’re behind with
our loading now. When that cotton train does
arrive, the captain will drive every soul like mad.
We were short-handed when we left New York.
The captain has taken on four men here at Galveston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
but he doesn’t like their looks. If they
aren’t any better than they appear, he might as
well not have hired them. But what is most
likely to delay us is the relative scarcity of roustabouts.
But if it’s humanly possible, he’ll be
loaded on time. The loss of the donkey-engine
may interfere very seriously with loading operations.
You never can tell when you are going to
need it. The thought of that and not the mere
injury to the engine is what made him so angry.
But remember this, Roy. Everything considered,
the captain handled you very gently. I
know it was because he realized that you were
sincere in your belief that you were acting for
the good of the ship. He didn’t believe a word
you said about the electricity. He thought you
imagined that you saw sparks. But whether you
believe it or not, he gave you full credit for trying
to do your duty.”</p>

<p>“He took a mighty queer way of showing it,”
said Roy, ruefully.</p>

<p>“He’s a queer man, Roy. But he’s absolutely
honest and absolutely just. His trouble
is to see past his prejudices.”</p>

<p>“Then how are you ever going to make him
understand about the donkey-engine?”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me, Roy. I know how to
manage it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>But if the purser did know, he apparently forgot
all about the matter. At least so it seemed to
Roy. Hours and even days passed with no further
reference to the affair by the purser, who was
again busy, and with no change in Captain Lansford’s
grim attitude toward Roy. It even
seemed to Roy as though the captain avoided
meeting him, and Roy could interpret that only
as meaning that the captain was still angry with
him and was annoyed at the sight of him. In
consequence, Roy was miserable, particularly because
he thought the purser had failed him. That
hurt, for Roy still suffered from boyish impatience.
He thought that the purser, if he
could remedy the matter at all, should be able to
fix it overnight.</p>

<p>Meantime, the process of loading went on
apace. The warehouse was emptied and every
possible preparation made to rush the loading
when finally the belated cotton train arrived.
Roy had watched with wonder the way the ship
was loaded in New York, but he was simply
astounded at the way the work went here. He
had always heard that southern darkies were indolent;
but there was nothing indolent about
these strapping, dusky roustabouts. They
seemed as tireless and tough as army mules.
Hour after hour they worked at top speed, shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the cotton bales into the <em>Lycoming’s</em> hold in
an uninterrupted stream and at a pace that was
past belief. Extra pay was offered them to work
over-hours, and by the aid of numerous electric
lights the work continued until well into the night.
Very early in the morning work was resumed.
So it went until the last bale was aboard. The
cargo was safely stowed and the hatches battened
down before the sailing hour had arrived.</p>

<p>Again Roy had to admit to himself that what
seemed impossible had once more been achieved
and that it had been accomplished by the captain.
Lovable he was not. But something about him
was so big and strong, so dominating, so overpowering,
that his spirit seemed to communicate
itself to those around him. Roy had often heard
of magnetism, without exactly understanding
what it was. Now that he actually saw it, he did
not recognize it as magnetism. All he knew was
that the captain, when aroused, seemed so utterly
to dominate those about him that they became for
the time being infused with his own spirit. And
that spirit simply would not admit the possibility
of failure. To Captain Lansford the word “if”
was unknown.</p>

<p>Long before the loading was completed the
last passenger was aboard, and there was nothing
to prevent the <em>Lycoming</em> from casting off on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the stroke of the hour. As sailing time approached,
Roy once more found himself busy.
As usual, there were messages to send for passengers
and more or less routine work to be done
in connection with the departure of the ship
itself.</p>

<p>By this time Roy’s shyness was beginning to
wear off. On the trip down he had purposely
kept aloof from passengers, and except for the
first officer, the chief engineer, and the purser, he
had made few friends. Now he felt more at
home. He had become familiar with his duties
and his position. He knew what was expected
of him. Naturally of a friendly disposition, he
was glad that his position permitted him to know
the various members of the crew and the passengers.
Of the men in the fire-room and the
sailors he saw little; but he now tried to cultivate
the acquaintance of the other officers and of some
of the passengers. His sunny disposition and
natural brightness soon made him a general favorite.
Had it not been for the captain’s uncompromising
attitude toward him, Roy would have
been quite happy. He felt that he was succeeding
in his work, and he could feel that those about
him liked him. But it still hurt him to think that
the purser had failed him.</p>

<p>On the first day out Roy was late in answering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the dinner call. As he passed the captain’s table,
on the way to his own, some one whispered audibly,
“There he is now.” A score of persons
looked around as Roy made his way to his own
seat. Hardly had he settled himself in his chair
before the purser’s voice rang out from a near-by
table. It was so unlike the pleasant-mannered
purser thus to talk in loud tones that Roy was
astonished. He paused to listen, as everybody
else seemed to be doing.</p>

<p>Distinctly he heard the purser saying, “Yes,
sir, saved the ship by his quick wit. The donkey-engine
belt was slipping and creating electricity
by friction. The broken end of a metal cotton
bale strap swaying close to the belt became electrified,
and the charge leaped across a break in
the strap, like a spark jumping the gap in a
spark-plug. There was no end of cotton and
hemp fibres swirling about in the wind, and the
spark itself occurred in some loose cotton that
had bulged out of the bale when the metal strap
broke. It was broad daylight and nobody saw
the spark but the wireless man. He was watching
for it. He knew that sparks would continue
to flash as long as the belt kept on generating
electricity and that another spark might set the
cotton afire. The chief engineer says it’s a miracle
that the cotton didn’t catch. If it had, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
flames would have spread like lightning with all
that loose stuff about and the wind blowing half a
gale. Fire would have been in the hold before
anybody could have said Jack Robinson, and
nothing short of a miracle could have saved the
ship. For there was no steam up to fight the
flames with. The chief engineer says that if Mr.
Mercer hadn’t acted so promptly, the <em>Lycoming</em>
would certainly not have been sailing to-day, to
say the least.”</p>

<p>During this recital the dining-saloon had become
as still as death. Not a knife clinked or a
glass tinkled. Every other voice was hushed.
The waiters paused in the aisles, trays held aloft,
until the purser concluded his recital. Speaking
as though to his own table only, the purser was
really addressing everybody in the dining-saloon.
Every one could hear him plainly and distinctly,
including Captain Lansford. Like everybody
else he listened carefully, but his face was inscrutable.</p>

<p>When Roy realized that the purser was talking
about him his cheeks flamed with embarrassment.
He bent his head and kept his eyes fastened on
his plate. As the purser continued his story, hot
anger came into Roy’s heart. It was quite bad
enough for the purser to fail to make an effort to
straighten out the matter with Captain Lansford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
But for the purser to humiliate him merely for
the sake of making a telling story was unforgivable.
For Roy could not conceive why the
purser should mention the matter before the entire
company of passengers unless it were that he
wanted to tell a striking story. Angry, confused,
embarrassed, Roy wanted to flee from the dining-saloon.
But he could not do so without making
himself conspicuous. There was nothing to do
but go on with his dinner. So angry and confused
that he hardly knew what he was putting
into his mouth, Roy tried to eat. But no sooner
had the purser stopped speaking than scores of
eyes were focused on Roy, and from every part
of the room complimentary remarks were flung
at him. Then somebody cried, “Speech! Let’s
hear from Mr. Mercer himself!” The cry was
taken up and the dining-saloon rang with the
summons, “Speech! Speech! Tell us more
about it, Mr. Mercer.”</p>

<p>Roy was paralyzed with embarrassment. He
had done nothing remarkable, nothing out of the
ordinary, and to be made a hero under such circumstances
was humiliating. In fact, in his worriment,
Roy had almost come to the conclusion
that the captain must be right and that far from
being a hero he was only a troublesome meddler.</p>

<p>“Speech! Speech!” continued the cries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>But Roy was dumb to all appeal. He looked
at his plate in silence and his face flamed like fire.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” cried the purser,
springing to his feet when he saw Roy’s embarrassment,
“Mr. Mercer is a man of deeds, not
words. Every one of us from the captain down
will feel safer because he is aboard. He evidently
does not want to talk and we shall not
make him. I owe him an apology for putting
him in such an embarrassing position. I’ll punish
myself by making a speech for him.”</p>

<p>The purser was both a ready and a witty
speaker and for several minutes he kept the
diners laughing at his good jokes. That gave
Roy time to regain his composure. By the time
the purser’s little speech was ended Roy was
quite himself again. When those seated at his
table turned to congratulate him he talked to
them frankly and without embarrassment, but refused
to discuss the incident the purser had described.
Numbers of people spoke to him when
the dinner was ended. Roy was glad when he
could escape and seek the seclusion of the wireless
house.</p>

<p>Yet he felt far from being hurt or mortified, as
he considered the matter calmly in the seclusion
of his own room. Every word that the purser
had said was true. The engine belt was generating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
electricity. He <em>had</em> prevented a fire by his
action. Of that he had not the slightest doubt.
But there was nothing in what he had done that
was in any sense heroic or that deserved especial
mention.</p>

<p>Any one else, seeing the danger, would have
acted to save the ship. The sole difference between
himself and others who were on the scene
was that he had realized the danger and they had
not. But he could claim no credit for that. He
was trained in electrical matters and would have
been a poor wireless man, indeed, if he had not
detected the danger.</p>

<p>The only question was whether or not he had
done his part well after discovering the danger.
Roy thought the matter over carefully. He
could not see that there was anything else he
could have done. And that belief made him feel
better pleased about the matter.</p>

<p>He didn’t want the passengers to consider him
a hero when he wasn’t a hero. But, on the whole,
Roy was glad the passengers knew about the
matter. He wanted to get acquainted with some
of them and the incident would make that an easy
matter. But most of all he was glad that the
story had been told before the captain. It was
worth the embarrassment he had suffered to know
that the captain had had to listen to the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
whether he wanted to or not, and to hear what
some of the ship’s officers, including the chief engineer,
thought about the matter. Yes, that certainly
was worth while. Roy felt that he could
almost forgive the purser for telling the story,
since the captain had had to listen to it.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought came to Roy. He pondered
a moment over it, then called out in astonishment
and mortification. “Why, you old
chump!” he said to himself, “that’s the very reason
the purser told the story&mdash;so that the captain
<em>would</em> have to listen to it. If the purser had
gone to him with an explanation, the captain
would have shut him off as he did me when I tried
to explain. All done for your own good, and
here you were doubting the purser and feeling
angry at him for trying to help you. I guess the
captain was right when he called you a wireless
infant. Thank goodness, I haven’t had a chance
to say anything to the purser, or I’d probably
have proved to him that I was a wireless fool as
well. You bet I won’t forget this lesson&mdash;or the
purser’s kindness, either.”</p>

<p>Presently the sober look disappeared from
Roy’s face and he began to chuckle. “Slick,
wasn’t it?” he muttered. “I wonder if the old
dragon realizes that the purser put one over on
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>If the captain did realize it, he gave no hint of
the fact. His treatment of both the purser and
Roy altered not a whit. But Roy was interested
to note that before they had been afloat twenty-four
hours the captain’s steward stepped into the
wireless house again, and after some conversation
casually asked for any news Roy had picked
up.</p>

<p>Roy had plenty of news to give him. The
Gulf coast was fairly dotted with wireless stations.
Brownsville, Port Arthur, Galveston,
New Orleans, Savannah, Key West, Pensacola,
Fort Crockett, Fort Dodd, and numerous other
Marconi or government stations fringed the great
body of water, some of which would always be
within reach of the <em>Lycoming</em>. The United
States Navy station at Guantanamo, the Marconi
stations at Miami, Jacksonville, Cape Hatteras,
and Virginia Beach, the navy stations at
Charleston and the Diamond Shoals light off
Hatteras, and the army stations at Fort Moultrie
and Fortress Monroe, were only a few of the land
stations that would likewise be within communicating
distance at some period of the journey.
Ship stations by the dozen would be within call
during the voyage, for there was a constant procession
of ships up and down the Atlantic coast&mdash;ships
sailing to or from home ports along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
ocean and the Gulf, vessels for Mexico, and Central
America, and Cuba, and steamers bound for
South American ports or destinations on the Pacific
via the Panama Canal.</p>

<p>Some of the stations would always be within
reach even though two hundred and fifty to three
hundred miles was about the limit of Roy’s calling
distance by day. When the atmosphere interfered
or thunder-storms were kicking up an
aerial disturbance, he was sometimes unable to
talk more than half that distance. Even the
slightest things made a difference&mdash;the temperature,
the nocturnal dampness, the contour of the
earth when talking to land stations, the level
spaces over the ocean. At the outside he could
not talk more than three hundred miles by day.
But at night, when he got “freak” workings, he
could sometimes send a thousand miles and receive
twice that distance. On more than one occasion
Roy had already distinctly caught the Arlington
weather signals, here in the Gulf, and
once he had picked up messages sent by the Tropical
Radio Telegraph Company, from its station
on the Metropolitan tower in New York to its
station in New Orleans.</p>

<p>On the second night out Roy sat at his post,
listening in. Voices were coming through the air
from every direction. It was a wonderful night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
for radio communication and Roy could hear
farther than he had ever heard before. Behind
him he could distinguish both the Marconi stations
at Galveston and at Fort Crockett, farther
up the island. The army post at Brownsville
was relaying a message from El Paso to the
Panama Canal. Roy wondered if it would carry
successfully over that great stretch of land and
water. The Charleston Navy Yard was flinging
out a call for the destroyer <em>Mills</em>, and finally an
answer came back from a point near Key West.
The <em>Mills</em> was ordered to proceed to Guantanamo
to coal. The navy operator at Key West was
talking to Havana. Behind him Roy could hear
the Mallory liner <em>Lampasas</em> sending private messages
for passengers. The Ward liner <em>Morro
Castle</em> was talking somewhere in the mist to the
eastward. The Clyde liner <em>Cherokee</em>, off to the
southeast, was calling for her sister ship <em>Comanche</em>.
Along the South Atlantic coast regular
processions of ships were moving in two lines,
some going north, others coming south, and all
talking at once. Distinctly Roy heard the call
signals and answers of the Ward liner <em>Monterey</em>,
the Mallory liner <em>Comal</em>, the Standard Oil boat
<em>Caloria</em>, the Red D liner <em>Caracas</em>, the Savannah
liners <em>City of Atlanta</em> and <em>City of Augusta</em>, and
the <em>Florida</em> of the Texas Company. He could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
even hear, far to the north, the Old Dominion
liner <em>Jamestown</em>, and the Merritt-Chapman
Wrecking Company’s <em>Rescue</em>.</p>

<p>But what most interested Roy was the nightly
news-letter flung abroad at the usual hour by the
New York Marconi station. It was easily
twelve hundred miles away, yet Roy could hear
every word distinctly. The captain would be interested
in this, and Roy picked up a pencil and
jotted down the night’s news: “Three-thousand-peasants-are-massacred-by-Hungarian-Reds&mdash;stop&mdash;Soviet-guard-shoots-and-hangs-revolters-at-Oldenburg&mdash;stop&mdash;Hungarian-Reds-beat-back-Czechs&mdash;stop&mdash;Pressburg-threatened&mdash;stop&mdash;Wilson-may-sail-in-ten-days&mdash;stop&mdash;Premiers-near-agreement&mdash;stop&mdash;Wilhelm-likely-to-escape-trial-envoys-think&mdash;stop&mdash;Punishment-of-ex-Kaiser-is-dead-issue&mdash;stop&mdash;French-will-try-Cavell&mdash;betrayer&mdash;stop&mdash;Hurley-asks-six-hundred-millions-to-finish-ships&mdash;stop&mdash;Says-Burleson-makes-United-States-pay-for-strike&mdash;stop&mdash;Telegraphers’-leader-says-people-must-stand-cost&mdash;stop&mdash;Victor-Berger-says-chaos-ahead&mdash;stop&mdash;Prosecution-of-socialists-will-bring-direct-action&mdash;stop&mdash;Britain-stirred-by-rumors-of-modified-peace&mdash;stop&mdash;Nicaraguans-ask-United-States-to-send-troops-to-prevent-threatened-invasion-from-Costa-Rica-by-army-now-massed-on-border&mdash;stop&mdash;First-state-will-ratify-national-suffrage-amendment-this-week&mdash;stop.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Then came the stock-market report and
the baseball scores.</p>

<p>Roy took down every word. Hardly had he
finished writing when a sound struck his ears that
momentarily stopped his heart.</p>

<p>“SOS,” came the signal, clear and distinct.
“SOS, SOS.” It was the international signal
of distress.</p>

<p>Other ears than Roy’s caught the cry for help
and in a second a hundred operators were fairly
yelling encouragement through the air.</p>

<p>“Who are you? Where are you? Give us
your location? What is the matter?”</p>

<p>It was a ship Roy did not know. She lay well
out in the Atlantic, and not in the usual steamship
lanes. She had broken her shaft and was
wallowing helplessly, unable to make repairs.
The barometer was going down and she wanted
to be helped to port. The nearest ships were
those in the west-bound lanes for transatlantic
liners. Presently Roy heard the navy station at
Arlington asking a west-bound liner to go to the
ship’s assistance.</p>

<p>Just as Roy was about to lay aside his receivers
for the night he heard the <em>Lycoming’s</em> call, clear
as a bell. It was Reynolds, the wireless man he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
had met in Galveston. Reynolds’ ship was off
Jacksonville. He reported the weather as threatening
and the sea rising, with a storm coming
from the north.</p>

<p>“Where are you?” asked Reynolds.</p>

<p>“In the Florida Straits,” replied Roy.</p>

<p>“You’ll catch it sometime to-morrow probably,”
flashed back Reynolds. “Good luck to
you. Look me up when you reach New York.
Good-night.”</p>

<p>It was now quite late. Unless the captain was
on watch, he was doubtless asleep. Roy was in
doubt as to what he should do, but finally decided
to take the news to the officer in charge. He was
the proper official to know about the approaching
storm. Roy copied down his weather-report and
the night’s news-letter, and made a note of the
SOS call and the communication from Reynolds.
Then he sought the bridge.</p>

<p>Mr. Young was in charge, the captain having
retired for the night. “Thank you, Mr. Mercer,”
he said, as Roy gave him the despatches. Then,
glancing them over, he went on, “So it’s getting
rough off Jacksonville, eh? I knew we were
heading into a storm. The barometer has been
falling steadily. It probably won’t be anything
more than a gale at this season. We’ll be in it
by noon and perhaps earlier. I am glad to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
about it, and I thank you for troubling to inform
me.”</p>

<p>“It’s no trouble,” said Roy. “I should think
every navigator would be more than glad to have
wireless service on his ship. Think of that helpless
liner out in the Atlantic with a storm coming
up. Where would she be if she couldn’t have
summoned help? I can’t understand how anybody
can feel the way Captain Lansford does.”</p>

<p>“There are some things past understanding,
Mr. Mercer. But perhaps things may happen
that will change the captain’s mind about wireless
telegraphy. Good-night.”</p>

<p>Roy went to his room and to bed, wondering if
he would ever have the chance suggested by Mr.
Young, of changing the captain’s attitude toward
him and his work. He thought of the ship out
on the ocean, lying helpless in the path of the
coming storm, and wondered if the opportunity
he longed for would come with that same storm.
He was a long time getting to sleep. Finally
his eyelids closed, but before they did Roy was
dimly conscious that the ship was rolling more
than she had since he had been a member of her
crew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A VISIT TO CHINATOWN</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">It was long after daybreak when Roy awoke.
He sat up on the edge of his bunk to look at
his timepiece, but almost immediately fell back
on his pillow. Something was wrong with him.
Roy had had very few illnesses in his life and he
did not at first know what ailed him. He felt
sick all over. He heard the ship’s bell strike and
realized that if he wanted any breakfast he would
have to hustle. But at the thought of food he
felt worse than ever. In fact, it seemed as
though he never wanted to take food again. The
very idea of it made him feel worse. Then he
knew what was the matter. He was seasick.</p>

<p>Presently he got to his feet and punched the
call bell. Then he lay down again. He became
conscious that the ship was rolling violently&mdash;at
least the motion seemed violent to Roy, though
a seasoned sailor would have smiled at the idea.
Sometimes a lurch of the ship almost threw Roy
out of bed. The wind was howling about the
wireless house. Things were rattling and creaking
under its pressure. Rain was falling. Roy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
was sure that the ship was in the midst of a terrible
and dangerous storm. He wondered if he
were needed. Then he wondered if he would be
able to get to his operating table. He felt so sick
that he was sure he was going to die.</p>

<p>Then Sam, the steward, appeared. Roy could
hardly believe his eyes when he saw the venerable
darky enter his room smiling. Roy didn’t see
how anybody could smile in such a storm. And
he said so to Sam.</p>

<p>“Lawd bless you, Mr. Mercer,” said Sam.
“Dis yere ain’t no great storm. It’s only a little
gale. Wait till you sees one o’ dem September
exenoxtail storms. Den you’ll know what a real
storm am like.”</p>

<p>Roy felt relieved. “I feel sick enough for
anything, Sam,” he said. “I don’t believe even
an equinoctial storm could make me feel any
worse. Can you do anything for me, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Lawd bless you, Mr. Mercer, I’ll fix you up
in no time. Jess you stay in bed till I gets
back,” and Sam disappeared through the doorway.
In a few moments he reappeared, with a
lemon and some concoction he had mixed in a
glass. Roy gulped the mixture down and presently
felt somewhat better. After a time he rose
and dressed, but he did not go near the breakfast
table. From time to time he sucked at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
lemon, as Sam had told him to do. By the middle
of the forenoon he felt much better. When
the dinner call came, he decided that he would go
down to the dining-room and perhaps eat some
soup.</p>

<p>He expected to be teased a little, but there was
almost no one to plague him. Chair after chair
was empty, only a few seasoned voyagers having
ventured to the dining-room. The purser was at
his table, smiling and jolly as usual. It cheered
Roy merely to look at him. The captain was not
present and Roy knew he was pacing the bridge.
However much he disliked Captain Lansford,
Roy knew that the commander would be found
at his post of duty in time of stress. But little
did Roy realize that before his time came to leave
the <em>Lycoming</em> he would see the day when, of all
the things for which he was grateful, he was most
thankful because Captain Lansford was in command
of the <em>Lycoming</em>.</p>

<p>By nightfall the ship had run past the storm,
and by the next day the wind was again blowing
at a normal velocity, though the water continued
to be rough.</p>

<p>The passengers rapidly recovered from their
seasickness, and left their staterooms. Again the
decks were peopled with a jolly throng. On the
sheltered side of the ship and on the after-deck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
passengers sat in intimate little groups chatting,
or in solitary aloofness, noses buried in the latest
novels or magazines. Steamer chairs were set in
rows, with indolent old ladies, corpulent men, and
weary invalids reclining at ease in them. In the
saloon little knots of passengers were gathered
about tables playing cards. Games were played
on the open parts of the deck, such as ring toss,
and bean bags. Altogether it was a happy company
aboard the <em>Lycoming</em>.</p>

<p>As is always the case at sea, formalities were
forgotten. Acquaintances were easily made and
before the voyage was half over everybody knew
everybody else. Roy profited by the opportunity
and soon was on speaking terms with most of the
passengers. His uniform was his introduction,
and after what the purser had said about him,
everybody was eager to make his acquaintance.</p>

<p>It was a real opportunity for Roy to cultivate
social grace, and he realized this. Keen of observation,
he had long ago noted the great differences
in manner in different persons. Some, by
their pleasing way, he saw, charmed and attracted
all with whom they came in contact, like
the purser. Others, like the captain, seemed to
repel and offend by their austerity of mien and
deportment. Aboard ship Roy met all types of
people and had abundant opportunity to study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
them and analyze the effects produced by their
conduct. Most of all he studied the purser.
Everybody liked the purser, and Roy saw that
this was invaluable to Mr. Robbins. He could
deal with more passengers in an hour than some
men could handle in double that time. And he
could obtain favors that were denied others. The
secret of Mr. Robbins’ power, Roy came to believe,
lay in his kindliness of heart, coupled with
his invariable cheerfulness and his unimpeachable
integrity. Roy came to understand that true
courtesy is merely good-will expressed through
kindness. The more he studied people the more
clearly Roy saw that a man’s manners have much
to do with his success or failure in life.</p>

<p>“If that’s the case,” thought Roy, “a fellow’s
a fool not to cultivate a pleasing way. What’s
the use of working hard to learn a trade or a profession
or a business and then lose half the advantage
of that training by lack of proper manners?”</p>

<p>Thereafter he consciously strove to make people
like him. That was not a difficult task, for
Roy was good-looking and both witty and sunny
in disposition. Before long he found himself a
general favorite. In a way that troubled Roy,
for passengers persisted in coming to the wireless
house, which was contrary to regulations. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
had to inform visitors that unless they came on
business he could not allow them in the wireless
house. As Roy was popular and everybody
aboard was interested in him and his work, passengers
began to send messages merely that they
might see something of the wireless house. The
result was a tremendous increase in business&mdash;an
increase which the Marconi people were not slow
to notice. Thus, although he did not realize it,
Roy was already profiting by his effort to cultivate
charm of manner.</p>

<p>Swiftly the days went by. The weather continued
fair and pleasant. Roy remained busy.
He had many messages to send for passengers
and at night he continued to take the time and
weather signals and to jot down the day’s news
for the captain. Most of all he loved to listen in
at night when the air was vibrant with wireless
voices. Every night he talked to Reynolds, and
soon felt as though they were old acquaintances.
Behind the <em>Lycoming</em>, Roy soon discovered, were
some of the vessels he had visited with the purser
in Galveston. He had many a conversation with
them before finally the <em>Lycoming</em>, just at dusk,
drew abreast of the signal station at Sandy
Hook, and a string of flags was hoisted above the
<em>Lycoming</em> announcing her safe arrival. The
flags came fluttering down and Roy knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the marine observer was probably already sending
out the news that the <em>Lycoming</em>, with cotton
aboard, had arrived from Galveston. It was
dark when the ship reached quarantine, and
dropped her anchor just off the Staten Island
shore to await a medical inspection in the morning.</p>

<p>The quarantine officials were astir early and
the <em>Lycoming</em> was soon on her way up the harbor.
Roy had no work to do, and he came out on deck
to enjoy the stirring scene. Mr. Young was in
command, and he invited Roy to join him on the
bridge. Roy was amazed at the great number of
ships in the harbor. Never had he seen anything
like so many. Ordinarily the waters of the upper
bay hold but few ships at anchor. Now there
were vast fleets of anchored ships. Usually, Roy
knew, tramp ships were almost the only vessels
to be found anchored in the harbor. But now he
saw dozens of fine, large ships that were quite
evidently liners, lying in one or another of the
various anchorages. He could make out the
names of some of the vessels, so that he was sure
he was right.</p>

<p>“How does it come,” he asked the first officer,
“that these liners lie here at anchor instead of at
their piers?”</p>

<p>“Because some other ships occupy their piers,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
explained Mr. Young. “The harbor has never
seen such congestion as exists now. It is relatively
as crowded as Fifth Avenue on a sunny
afternoon. So many ships now come to this port
that it is necessary to have a marine traffic squad,
just as they have a traffic squad ashore to direct
land traffic. You have seen traffic policemen at
the street corners holding up traffic and sending
it this way and that. If you keep your eyes open,
you will see the same thing out here on the water.
Dozens of great liners are arriving daily with soldiers
and war supplies and the usual freight of
commerce. Docking space gave out long ago,
so the traffic squad regulates the matter of unloading,
assigning different docks to the different
ships as fast as there is room. Sometimes there
are more than 150 great ships lying at anchor at
one time. Many of these are craft built since the
war began. Every night a number of ships arrive
off quarantine, just as we did, and they must
anchor there until examined by the officials. The
doctors get to work at six-thirty and the early
part of the day is a pretty busy time in this harbor.
Every morning there’s a regular procession
of ships steaming up to their piers from
quarantine.”</p>

<p>Roy looked behind him and saw several ships
following the <em>Lycoming</em>. There were four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
ahead of the <em>Lycoming</em>, but he had not realized
what a string of incoming ships there was. Suddenly
a swift little craft came darting across the
water, straight toward the advancing line of
ships.</p>

<p>“There’s one of the patrol boats,” said Mr.
Young. “Probably it has directions for some
of us.”</p>

<p>The little boat, which was one of seven patrol
boats directing the traffic, steamed directly toward
the ship immediately ahead of the <em>Lycoming</em>,
turned when abreast of her, and shot close to
her side. A traffic official shouted something
through a megaphone and waved his hand toward
the statue of Liberty. At once the big ship
swung toward Bedloe’s Island, and in a few minutes
Roy heard her chain rattle as she dropped
her anchor. Meantime, the patrol craft had sped
past the <em>Lycoming</em>, the man with the megaphone
directing Mr. Young to proceed to his accustomed
dock.</p>

<p>“I’m glad they aren’t going to hold us up,”
said Mr. Young, as he rejoined Roy. “We
might swing at anchor for a week if we ever got
into that crowd.”</p>

<p>He waved his hand toward the western anchorage,
where a great fleet of ships tugged at their
anchor chains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, there are dozens and dozens of them,”
exclaimed Roy. “They seem to be anchored in
groups.”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is to make room for ships to
pass. You see there is one big group between
Robbins’ Reef light and the Jersey shore. That
is an anchorage for general cargoes. Then you
notice a great pier built out from the Jersey shore
and the narrow channel leading to it. Just north
of that channel a little way is the anchorage
ground for ships loaded with explosives. It is
just below Black Tom Island, where that awful
explosion occurred during the war. Above that
point the anchorage extends north of Ellis Island.
Altogether that’s a space several miles
long, and it’s just jammed with ships. Over on
the Brooklyn side and even far up the Hudson
the anchorages are crowded.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I have seen this,” said Roy. “It
is wonderful.”</p>

<p>“You may well be glad. We used to think
New York harbor was a pretty busy place before
the war, but it was dead compared with the present
conditions. I don’t know what we’ll do if
traffic continues to increase the way it has been
increasing the last few months. The only thing
that saves the harbor from utter confusion now is
the traffic squad. Its power is absolute and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
have to do exactly as the patrolmen say. So they
keep excellent order and prevent all sorts of
trouble. But I tell you they are strict. It
doesn’t take much of an offense to bring a fine on
a ship captain, and for a serious offense he may
even lose his papers.”</p>

<p>Just then Captain Lansford came on the
bridge with a despatch in his hand. “I will take
charge, Mr. Young,” he said. Then, turning to
Roy, he said brusquely, “Send this.”</p>

<p>Roy took the despatch from the captain and returned
to the wireless house. There was the
usual number of messages to send for the passengers,
telling of a safe arrival, and by the time
Roy came out of the wireless house again, the
<em>Lycoming</em> lay snug in her dock. Hatches and
ports were open, and the derrick booms were
creaking as they hoisted from the hold great
slingfuls of trunks and other baggage. The
purser, as usual at such a time, was buried under
an avalanche of work, and Roy spent the day
helping him. He had formed a real affection
for the purser, and was rapidly making himself
invaluable to that official. Having assisted him
once before, Roy was now somewhat familiar
with the purser’s work. The thought that he was
really helping his friend gave Roy genuine pleasure.
He was so busy and so preoccupied that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
he did not notice the clamor and racket on the
pier, as the ship was unloaded, or hear the roar
and clatter from the water-front.</p>

<p>Night hushed the discordant noises of the day
as effectually as though some one had clamped a
lid down on them. The streets were already deserted
and quiet when Mr. Robbins threw down
his pen and heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“There,” he exclaimed, “that’s a good day’s
work&mdash;a mighty good day’s work. And the
Bible tells us the laborer is worthy of his hire.
Get your cap, Roy, and we’ll get something to
eat. No ship’s grub for us to-night, eh?”</p>

<p>They went ashore, caught an up-town subway
train in a few minutes, and got out at Worth
Street. A short walk took them through an
Italian district to Chinatown. Roy had never
visited Chinatown before. He was so much interested
in what he saw that the purser could
hardly drag him away from the shop-windows.
There were wonderful pieces of needlework on
display, intricate and weird carvings of ivory and
ebony, curious little trinkets and ornaments of
jade and semiprecious stones, vases little and
large, brass trays and ornaments, and a thousand
other unfamiliar and strange objects. But what
interested Roy more than anything else was the
strange foods displayed in the provision shops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
There were dried fish, dried fowls, dried meats,
curious candies made of some gummy substance
covered with queer little seeds, or dried orange-peel
or other vegetable growths covered with a
coating of sugar. There were Chinese cabbages,
unlike any cabbage Roy had ever seen, for instead
of being round or flat, they were tall and
urn-like, or even cylindrical. There were curious
creamy-white little things in big baskets that
the purser said were bamboo shoots, and water-chestnuts
that looked like lily bulbs.</p>

<p>The purser led the way to a restaurant in Pell
Street. Its atmosphere was so strange and foreign
that Roy was almost startled. Heavy, curiously
wrought hangings decorated the walls.
Great screens, ornamented with elaborate needlework,
stood here and there. Dragons and curious
birds were wrought on them. Grilles of
elaborately carved ebony divided the dining-room
into smaller compartments. The little tables
and the stools about them were of teak-wood or
ebony, elaborately carved by hand, and very
heavy. Lustrous banners with heavy dragons
on them hung here and there. Slit-eyed Chinese
stood silent and inscrutable in their curious dress,
ready to take orders. The odor that pervaded
the place was unlike anything Roy had ever
smelled. Partly it was the odor of cooking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
partly of incense, partly of tobacco, though Roy
was not able to analyze it. All he knew was that
it was as unusual and striking as the bizarre decorations.</p>

<p>“Lots of people would not think of eating in
a Chinese restaurant,” said the purser as they
seated themselves, “but such a prejudice is unreasonable
and foolish. Chinese cooks are clean.
They are probably the best cooks in the world,
not even excepting the French, who have such a
great reputation. You see China swarms with a
population really too great to be supported by
the country’s resources. So the greatest thing
in a Chinaman’s existence is the food problem.
Everybody learns to cook, and to make delectable
dishes out of almost nothing. In all the world
there are no more delicious foods than some the
Chinese make. As you probably don’t know
what to order, I am going to take the liberty of
ordering for us both.”</p>

<p>The purser called the waiter and ordered
chicken omelette, fried noodles, a little chop suey,
a ham omelette, some preserved kumquats, and
some Chinese candy. He told the waiter to
bring the dishes one at a time so that they would
be warm. While the cook was preparing the
order, the waiter brought two bowls of rice and
a pot of tea, with sugar and some tiny cups. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Robbins filled the cups and they sampled the
beverage. Roy had never tasted such delicious
tea. Nor had he ever seen rice cooked like that
in the bowls. It was perfectly cooked yet dry
and flaky. It was not at all the mushy stuff he
had eaten in American homes.</p>

<p>“The Chinese,” explained Mr. Robbins, “eat
rice just as we do bread. Most of their dishes
are more or less greasy or soupy, and the rice
takes up the gravy very nicely. Chinamen eat it
with chop-sticks, and they will bring you some if
you want to try it. But I suspect you will make
much better weather of it if you use a fork.”</p>

<p>Roy laughed. “A fork for mine,” he said.</p>

<p>Presently the waiter brought a ham omelette.
Mr. Robbins cut it in half and served it. “Bring
the chop suey, too,” he said.</p>

<p>That was fetched and they fell to. But Roy
hadn’t eaten more than two bites before he
stopped and looked at the purser.</p>

<p>“That omelette is the best thing I ever
tasted,” he commented.</p>

<p>“Wait till the chicken omelette comes,” smiled
the purser.</p>

<p>They ate the ham omelette and nibbled at the
chop suey as a side-dish. Then the waiter
brought the chicken omelette and the fried noodles.
The chicken omelette wasn’t so much unlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
a good chicken potpie, but it was more delicious
than any chicken dish Roy had ever eaten.
The noodles were curious little slivers of dough
fried crisp and covered with gravy. They were
good, too. But Roy was sure he had never
tasted anything so delicious as the two omelettes.
He ate until he could hold no more.</p>

<p>When they left the restaurant Roy thanked
the purser for the treat. “I’m obliged to you for
the food,” he said, “but I’m more obliged to you
for showing me something new. I might never
have known about the Chinese way of cooking if
it hadn’t been for this experience.”</p>

<p>“Good!” smiled the purser. “I’m glad you
put it that way. Lots of people lose a great deal
of fun and happiness in this life because they
aren’t willing to try new things. The older we
get, the worse our prejudices become.”</p>

<p>Roy’s face grew serious at once. “I should
say so,” he answered. “Look at Captain Lansford.
Why, his ship is a thousand times safer
because he has a wireless outfit. Yet he doesn’t
like it at all. It hardly seems possible that anybody
can be so unreasonable.”</p>

<p>“It does not. Yet the world is full of such
foolish prejudices.”</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Roy, “I hope that I’ll never
get like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“You won’t if you try not to, Roy. But you
may if you don’t. You know eternal vigilance is
the price of liberty. And that applies to mental
liberty as well as political.”</p>

<p>They walked slowly back to the ship, passing
again through the lower end of the down-town
Italian district. Roy was instantly attracted by
the names on the shop fronts and the objects
offered for sale, particularly the oddly-shaped
and highly-colored candies and pastry.</p>

<p>“My, but there are a lot of Italians here,” said
Roy. “Almost enough to make a city by themselves.”</p>

<p>The purser smiled. “Do you know what is
the largest Italian city in the world, Roy?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Rome, I suppose,” answered Roy.</p>

<p>“New York City,” said the purser. “There
are more Italians here than Rome or any other
city in Italy ever saw at one time.”</p>

<p>Roy expressed his surprise.</p>

<p>“And there are more Jews here than ever inhabited
Jerusalem,” continued the purser.
“New York has more than 7,000,000 population&mdash;more
people than most of our states contain&mdash;and
among those millions are a great number of
colonies of foreigners, each large enough to make
a good-sized city. Some day we’ll make a trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
through the Italian sections and try some Italian
cooking.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” said Roy. “That’ll be my treat.”</p>

<p>When they reached the ship the purser said
good-night. Roy went to the wireless house and
caught the weather-report and listened to some of
the messages scudding through the air. But
when he was ready to retire he was as wide-awake
as he would have been at noon, although it was
past midnight. The unaccustomed amount of
tea he had drunk had made him sleepless. It was
a beautiful, warm June night, and Roy went out
and sat on the deck to watch the stars and the
twinkling lights ashore and in the harbor.</p>

<p>How long Roy sat there he did not know, but
it was some time after two bells, and the harbor
was as quiet as it ever becomes, when Roy heard
the sound of a motor-boat. There was nothing
unusual in that and Roy would have given the
matter no thought had not the engine suddenly
stopped. The sound seemed to have been
straight out from the <em>Lycoming’s</em> pier. Roy at
once thought that the little craft was suffering
from engine trouble. He wondered where and
what it was and if help were needed. Thinking
he might be able to see its lights, Roy walked to
the stern and sat down on a life-raft. No lights
were visible. That did not seem strange, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Roy’s vision was obstructed on either hand by a
long pier shed. Near the Jersey shore a ferry-boat,
brilliantly illuminated, was drawing into its
slip, and Roy almost forgot the motor-boat as he
watched the distant ferry.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he sat straight up with a start.
The sound of oars came to his ears. They were
dipping slowly and gently in the water and ordinarily
such a slight sound would have been indistinguishable.
But the silent, empty pier sheds
acted as sounding-boards and both magnified and
reflected the sound. Roy’s first thought was that
the passengers in the motor-boat had abandoned
their craft and were coming ashore in a rowboat.
He wondered how they would make a landing,
for the doors of the pier sheds were tightly closed.
Probably, thought Roy, they see the lights of the
<em>Lycoming</em> and hope to get aboard her. The
dock between the piers was so dark that Roy
could hardly see anything in it. He strained his
eyes but could not make out the boat. He was
about to call out to it, for he was certain that it
was in the dock, when it occurred to him that if
the occupants of the boat were in distress they
would make their presence known. Then, for
the first time, he thought of thieves.</p>

<p>Just then the glowing ferry-boat came directly
astern of the <em>Lycoming</em>; and, although it was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the other side of the river, the broad reflection of
its lights in the water, like a ribbon of gold,
showed Roy the boat he was looking for. He
could see it but dimly, yet he was certain that the
craft below him was the motor-boat itself. Three
men were in it. One was carefully propelling it
with long oars, and the attitudes of the two others
showed that great caution was being observed in
the approach.</p>

<p>Roy sat still as an image. He was now fully
convinced that the men in the boat were thieves.
What they were after he could not conceive.
They could not hope to get aboard the <em>Lycoming</em>,
for a sailor was on watch. Nor could they
hope to break into a pier shed. Roy crushed
down his desire to raise an alarm and sat silent,
determined to discover what they were up to before
he made any move. If the <em>Lycoming</em> were
their object, he would thwart them. He had not
long to wait. Very cautiously the motor-boat
crept near the <em>Lycoming</em>. A long, low whistle
was heard and all was still again. Then Roy
heard an indistinct, guarded sound, like the careful
raising of a window, followed by a low whistle.
The motor-boat stole cautiously to the very
side of the <em>Lycoming</em>. Roy crept to the edge of
the deck, in order to keep the boat under observation,
and peered down. Distinctly he could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
that one of the lower ports was open and two
heads were thrust out. Then the heads disappeared
and a moment later a small bale of something
came slowly through the port and was
seized by the men in the motor-boat. They
stowed it away in the boat, then turned again to
the open port.</p>

<p>Roy had seen enough. It was time for action.
But what should he do? Roy’s mind worked
like lightning. If he raised an outcry the thieves
would start their engine and be off while their
confederates on the <em>Lycoming</em> would slip back to
their quarters. If the thieves were to be caught,
it must be done by stealth. But how? In a second
Roy thought of the wireless.</p>

<p>Cautiously drawing back from the edge of the
deck, he tiptoed rapidly to the wireless house,
threw open his switch, and sent forth a call.</p>

<p>“KIN&mdash;KIN&mdash;KIN&mdash;WNA,” flashed his
signal through the night.</p>

<p>Almost immediately came back the answer,
“WNA&mdash;III&mdash;GA.” It was the police boat
<em>Patrol</em> replying to Roy’s frantic call.</p>

<p>“This is the Confederated liner <em>Lycoming</em>,
pier 14, North River,” rapped out Roy as fast as
he could work his key. “Thieves in motor-boat
taking stuff from confederates in the ship.
What shall we do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Watch. Raise no alarm until we enter the
slip.”</p>

<p>It was no great distance to Harbor A Station
and Roy knew that the <em>Patrol</em> would be at the
end of the slip in a short time. He tiptoed down
the ladder and hurried to the officers’ quarters.
All was in darkness. He tried the captain’s
door. It was locked. Roy dared not rap on it
for fear of alarming the thieves. Mr. Young’s
door was also fastened. But the second officer’s
door opened under Roy’s hand. The occupant
was snoring like a fat hog. Roy shook him by
the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Mr. Adams,” he said softly. “Wake up.
Thieves are at work below.”</p>

<p>The second officer was on his feet in a flash.
“Where?” he demanded, rushing toward the
door.</p>

<p>“Wait!” said Roy. “If we want to catch
them, we mustn’t make a sound. Some of the
crew are passing stuff out of an open port to men
in a motor-boat. I’ve called the police and they
will be here in a minute. They’ll pull into the
slip and catch the men in the boat and we’ll grab
the men on the ship. If you have a flash-light,
put it in your pocket. We’ll need it down in the
dark hold.”</p>

<p>“You watch for the police boat,” said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Adams. “I’ll get some sailors and be ready to
grab those fellows in the hold.”</p>

<p>Roy stole to the deck and cautiously watched
the dark forms below. His heart beat so loud he
was afraid the thieves would hear him. Seconds
seemed like minutes. Time seemed actually to
stand still, so fearful was he that the thieves
would get away before the police came. Anxiously
he kept glancing at the end of the slip, but
the <em>Patrol</em> did not come. Meantime, the motor-boat
was loaded almost to capacity. If the police
did not arrive soon it would be too late.
Suddenly Roy became aware that a rowboat was
stealing along the other side of the slip. It was
more than half-way in before Roy discovered
it. The boatmen rowed with muffled oars, but
came on swiftly. Were they more thieves?
Roy did not know what to do. It was useless
to call the police again. Why didn’t they
hurry?</p>

<p>Meantime the rowboat came silently on. It
stole along the far side of the slip until nearly
opposite the <em>Lycoming</em>, then shot toward the
motor-boat. Roy was in an agony of uncertainty.
He could do nothing but watch and
pray for the police to make haste.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a great light flashed from the
bow of the rowboat and fell full on the men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the motor-boat. “Hands up or we’ll shoot,”
came a stern warning.</p>

<p>The rowboat was full of policemen. The
thieves hesitated a second, then raised their hands
above their heads. The rowboat glided alongside
the motor-boat, the thieves were skilfully
searched for weapons, handcuffed, and transferred
to the police boat.</p>

<p>Meantime an uproar arose within the ship’s
hold. There were curses, cries, and blows. But
the noise soon subsided, for two policemen
leaped through the open port and helped to subdue
the thieves on board. The latter were
dragged to the deck and there recognized as the
men who had joined the crew at Galveston. The
noise had aroused everybody aboard. Captain
Lansford came running down the stairway, inquiring
about the disturbance.</p>

<p>“We discovered these men passing stuff out to
some thieves in a motor-boat,” explained Mr.
Adams, “and while the police attended to the
fellows outside, we grabbed those in the hold.”</p>

<p>Roy, coming down the stairway, heard every
word. His heart flamed with indignation. Mr.
Adams had not even mentioned him, but had
taken full credit for the capture. Roy was not
seeking for glory, but under the circumstances he
did want the captain to know the truth. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
almost minded to speak out, especially when the
captain said, “Excellent, Mr. Adams. These
fellows are probably smugglers, and if that
proves to be the case, you have saved me a lot of
trouble. I shall remember this.”</p>

<p>That was high praise from Captain Lansford,
and Roy’s face burned with indignation as he listened.
Wisely, however, he held his peace. A
moment later he was glad he had. The roundsman
in charge of the police came on deck and
asked for the wireless man. When Roy was
pointed out, he said, “Young man, I want to
thank you for the good judgment you showed.
This is a gang we’ve been after for months, and
they would have given us the slip again if there
had been the least alarm. We are obliged to you
and your captain ought to be more so.”</p>

<p>Roy’s face flushed again, but this time for a
far different reason. His heart beat with joy.
But all the joy faded when the captain, after
learning the truth, turned to him and said sternly,
“Mr. Mercer, in a case of this sort you should
have notified the commanding officer at once.
Your failure to do so is inexcusable.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A CLOSE CALL</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Poor Roy! No matter how hard he tried,
it seemed, the captain would still be dissatisfied
with him. To Roy the captain’s harsh remark
seemed the very essence of injustice. He
did not desire praise. He neither expected nor
wished any special consideration. But he did desire
just recognition of his services. If the captain
was truthful in telling Mr. Adams that the
capture of the thieves had saved him, Captain
Lansford, from trouble, then, it seemed to Roy,
the captain should have thanked him instead of
reprimanding him. Bitter, indeed, were Roy’s
thoughts.</p>

<p>Again it was the kind-hearted purser who
helped Roy in his difficulty. Like everybody
else on board, Mr. Robbins was aroused by the
hubbub. He threw on some clothes and hurried
to the deck to see what was wrong. There he
speedily learned about the capture of the thieves;
and Sam, the steward, told him of Roy’s part in
the affair and what the captain had said to Roy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The purser waited to hear no more. In another
minute he was in the wireless house. “I
hear you have done a fine piece of work, Roy,”
he said. “I congratulate you. Everybody is
talking about it.”</p>

<p>There was no joy in the face Roy turned to his
friend. “Everybody but the captain, perhaps,”
he sighed. “He gave me thunder again. Is
there <em>anything</em> that would satisfy him? I’ve
worked my head nearly off on this trip and he
will barely speak to me. Now I have helped
prevent a theft and if what the captain says is
true, I have helped keep him out of difficulty.
And what do I get for it? A reprimand before
the entire crew.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” demanded the purser, as
though it were news to him. “Tell me what
happened.”</p>

<p>After Roy had related the entire incident in
detail, the purser said sympathetically, “That
does seem rough. But perhaps you don’t fully
understand the captain’s position, Roy. You
see, he’s responsible for any smuggling that goes
on in this ship. If smuggling is done and the
revenue officers discover it, the captain may be
punished. Naturally, when he is aboard and
smugglers are discovered at work, he wants to
know about it. You wouldn’t want a sailor from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the forecastle sending out important despatches
for you, particularly if you were aboard, would
you?”</p>

<p>“You bet I wouldn’t,” promptly answered
Roy. “It might get me into a heap of trouble
with the Marconi people.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s exactly the way the captain saw
the matter. What was going on below might
have gotten him into no end of trouble with the
government. He was here to handle the matter
himself. Instead of calling him, a boy with no
experience attempts to manage the affair. Do
you see how it appeared to the captain?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Roy soberly, “and I don’t blame
him. But he might at least have asked why I
didn’t call him. There were reasons why I
couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Ah! That is another matter, Roy. That is
where the captain was too hasty. It is always
dangerous to jump at conclusions. But you must
remember that the captain’s whole training has
been to act and act quick. When things go
wrong on a ship or the craft is in danger, the captain
has to do something and do it quick. When
you are half a thousand miles from land and your
ship is in danger of going to the bottom, you can’t
sit around and think or hold courts of inquiry,
Roy. You have to do something instantly. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
captain has been doing that for thirty years and
it has become a habit. Just wait until we get in
some tight pinch. You’ll be so glad we have a
captain aboard who knows what to do and how to
do it quick that you’ll forgive all the overhasty
things he does in times of quiet.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you told me all this,” said Roy.
“I still think the captain was unjust, but I feel
differently about the matter. And I’ll feel more
so if they prove to be smugglers instead of plain
thieves.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’s any doubt about their
being smugglers. Let’s go down and see what
the police have discovered.”</p>

<p>They descended to the deck. The ship’s lights
had been turned on and the stolen goods hoisted
aboard. They were small bales of hemp. A
policeman was breaking one of them open. Roy
remembered that they had been brought aboard
with the very first of the cargo and trucked to the
forward part of the ship. Evidently they had
immediately been secreted by the four smugglers
who had joined the crew and were at work in the
hold. When the policeman had torn away a part
of the hemp, out rolled a four-gallon can filled
with liquid. The screw-cap was cautiously removed
and the policeman gingerly sniffed the
contents. Then a smile spread over his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s the real stuff, Rounds,” he said, passing
the can to the waiting roundsman.</p>

<p>The roundsman sampled the liquor. “The
very same,” he replied, “and worth a good many
dollars a gallon. If the twenty-four bales each
contain four gallons, we’ve captured two good
hogsheads of whiskey for Uncle Sam, and saved
him a nice little sum of revenue. We’ll just take
the booze along with the prisoners, Captain
Lansford.”</p>

<p>“You are welcome to both,” said the captain.
“We’ll make sure there is no more of the stuff
aboard. If we find any, I’ll let you know.
Meantime, I’m obliged to you for catching these
fellows.”</p>

<p>“You’d better thank your wireless man, Captain.
They’d have got away with the stuff sure,
if it hadn’t been for him. And we’d have missed
them again.” Then, turning to Roy, the roundsman
thanked him warmly. The whiskey and the
prisoners were put into the captured motor-boat,
and towing their rowboat behind them, the
police went chugging back to Harbor A.</p>

<p>During the days that the <em>Lycoming</em> lay in her
dock, Roy spent many an hour in sober thought.
He had had a taste of life afloat now, and more
than ever he felt sure that he wanted to be a wireless
man. He wanted to succeed. He wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to reach the very top in his chosen calling. No
boy was ever more ambitious, ever more willing
to work hard. Indeed, the unusual quality in
Roy, the thing that distinguished him from most
lads of his age, was the fact that he had early
grasped the idea that the road to success is named
work.</p>

<p>Always Roy had done things with a will.
When he played, he played hard. When he
studied, he studied hard. And after he had become
interested in radio communication, he had
striven hard to perfect himself as an operator.
He understood his instruments perfectly. He
could make new parts or entire new instruments,
if given the materials. He could improvise a
wireless outfit out of next to nothing. He could
read messages as fast as any human hand could
send them, and he could himself transmit with unusual
speed. In short, despite his youth, Roy
was an unusually skilful wireless man.</p>

<p>But he lacked what most boys lack. He lacked
experience of life and the sane judgment that
should go with experience. He lacked perspective.
He was impatient. He could not always
see matters in their true relationship.</p>

<p>It was so now as he meditated concerning his
own situation. He forgot that he had been
aboard the <em>Lycoming</em> hardly a month. He did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
not realize that the captain really knew nothing
concerning his training and ability. He did not
understand that before a man like Captain Lansford
could place confidence in a subordinate, that
subordinate would have to prove his entire trustworthiness.
And Roy had as yet had no real
test. His work had so far been all fair-weather
work.</p>

<p>But the thing that Roy understood least of all
was the captain’s actual attitude toward him.
He thought that the captain disliked him, that he
felt spiteful toward him, that he was purposely
trying to humiliate him. Had Roy understood
the actual situation he might have felt even worse.
That was, that Captain Lansford was hardly
conscious that Roy was a member of his crew.
He was for some reason prejudiced against wireless,
and he had for so many years navigated his
ship without the help of wireless that he gave no
more heed to the innovation than he would to a
new plank laid on the deck. Roy’s messages concerning
the weather he took lightly. He had a
barometer of his own that for thirty years had
told him all he needed to know about the weather.
Roy’s news-letters were more or less diverting.
But the captain had gone without the day’s news
for so many years that he had no hunger for it, as
the constant newspaper reader has. It mattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
little to him whether he ever saw a paper or
not.</p>

<p>But it did matter about the safety and punctuality
of his ship. No mariner alive was prouder
of his record, more jealous of his reputation, or
more determined to keep up his good work.
Every minute the captain had the welfare of his
ship in mind. Only those who had proved their
ability did he trust. He wanted them to prove
it under his own tutelage, and his was a stern way
of training recruits.</p>

<p>Thus it was that while Roy was fretting his
heart out at what he considered the captain’s dislike
of him and injustice toward him, the captain
was hardly giving Roy a thought. He was
tolerating him as he tolerated the wireless aerial
swinging aloft; both had been ordered by the
owners.</p>

<p>So Roy’s situation was far from being the
hopeless one he considered it. The dropping of
water will wear away even the hardest stone.
Continued good service was certain to make an
impression on even Captain Lansford’s stern
nature. And real service to the ship could not
fail to impress the captain deeply, since his ship’s
welfare was the captain’s one passion.</p>

<p>Could Roy have realized all this it would have
saved him many a heartburn. He did understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
however, that the way to make good in any
job was through efficient service. So the captain’s
course, although it hurt and angered Roy,
really spurred him to greater efforts. Some
boys, in a similar situation, would have become
careless and sullen. Roy maintained his courteous,
cheery manner and worked harder than ever.
He was on his mettle and was determined that he
would force recognition from his captain. And
that was the very best attitude he could have
taken.</p>

<p>Although it is a long lane that has no turning,
it seemed to Roy that he was an extremely long
time in reaching the bend in his particular path.
Things went on in the same old, uneventful way.
He took messages and sent them. He faithfully
caught the weather-reports, the storm signals,
and the night’s news. And all these made
about as much impression on Captain Lansford
as did the regular turning of one of the piston-rods
in the engine room. Roy saw that if he were
going to make a dent in Captain Lansford’s consciousness,
he would have to do something out of
the ordinary routine. Think as he might, no opportunity
seemed to present itself. That made
Roy keener than ever; and he soon reached the
point where he spent almost as much time considering
the welfare of the ship as the captain did.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Everywhere and always he was asking himself
the question, “What can I do to help run the
ship?”</p>

<p>The period of unloading and loading passed,
and the <em>Lycoming</em> started south again, but still
Roy’s opportunity did not come. He chafed under
the placid routine of his life as a captured
tiger chafes in its cage.</p>

<p>The turn in the lane was near at hand, however,
or at least there was a slight bend directly
ahead. That turn came in the form of a fog.</p>

<p>Bright skies and a summer sun looked down
upon the <em>Lycoming</em> as she bade farewell to New
York and sailed through the Narrows toward the
open sea. Twenty-four hours later she was
buried in a fog-bank. A great, gray, swirling
mass of mist came drifting up from the south,
cutting off the vision as effectually as a curtain
hides a stage. In no time everything was wet
and clammy. Rails, rigging, window-sills,&mdash;everything
was adrip with condensed moisture.
A raw, damp quality pervaded the atmosphere.
The barometer was falling and the wind rising.
To make matters worse, it began to rain. At
first the rain was hardly more than a heavy mist.
Then it fell in gentle drops. As the wind rose
the rain poured downward in torrents, driving in
sheets before the fitful blasts of the gale. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
searched out every crack and crevice, and came
driving under doors and oozing in under tightly
closed window-sashes.</p>

<p>The little wireless house, on the very top of the
ship, caught the full force of wind and rain.
Water came under Roy’s door in such a stream
that he had to mop it up with a rag. At first
he felt little concern. The sea had not yet risen,
and the ship was not rolling much, though occasionally
it seemed to stagger before a great gust
of wind. Having gone through a pretty fair
gale, Roy saw by comparison that this storm, at
least as yet, was nothing to feel disturbed
about.</p>

<p>But when he looked out of his window, and
particularly when he opened his door a moment
later, he felt instant concern. The ship was
literally swallowed up, buried in the densest bank
of fog Roy had ever known. He could not see
in any direction. He could hardly make out the
ship’s nose with distinctness. Under the buffeting
of the wind the steamer creaked and groaned.
Windows rattled. Everything that was not
lashed fast thumped and pounded. The fitful
blasts whistled in the rigging and shrieked and
howled about the little wireless house, and the
roar of the storm almost drowned the sound
of the fog-horn. If he could not hear the deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
bellow of the <em>Lycoming’s</em> great fog-horn, he
asked himself, how could those on other ships
hear it? Instantly Roy was alarmed.</p>

<p>Long ago, he knew well enough, the captain
had jumped into oilskins and boots and sou’-wester
and joined Mr. Young on the bridge.
Into Roy’s mind came a picture of the captain at
his post, pacing from side to side of the bridge,
standing rigid, like a pointing setter, as he listened
with cupped hand to his ear, now on the
port side, now on the starboard, and all the while
seeking to pierce with his eagle eyes that vast,
impenetrable, treacherous mass of fog. In his
anxiety Roy pulled on his raincoat and stepped
to the deck to listen. He was blinded by the
torrent of rain and almost bowled over by the
blasts of wind. He clung to the hand-rail and
listened, peering intently into the mist. He saw
nothing but fog and heard only the hoarse shriek
of the ship’s whistle and the roar of the wind.
He turned back and shut the door. Every moment
he felt more fearful, for he knew there must
be ships in the vicinity. And now he began to
feel grateful that Captain Lansford was on the
bridge. Every time he thought of that tall, undaunted
figure pacing the bridge, Roy felt safer.</p>

<p>A great desire to help in the battle with the
elements came to Roy. But what could he do?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
He might call other ships and get replies, but
how would that help? They could not locate the
<em>Lycoming</em> any more than he could locate them.
Besides, he didn’t know what ships to call, what
vessels were in his vicinity.</p>

<p>“But I can find out,” muttered Roy. “Maybe
the captain would like to know.”</p>

<p>When Roy became the <em>Lycoming’s</em> wireless
man, he subscribed for the <cite>New York Herald</cite>.
Daily the paper came to the office on the pier,
where Roy got it. When he returned from his
first voyage, he secured the back numbers that
had come during his absence. And from every
Issue since he became a subscriber, Roy had
clipped the shipping news and carefully filed it
away. He had had a vague notion that some
day these clippings might be useful. Already
the time had come, for his clippings contained
very complete shipping news from all parts of
the world. They would tell him what ships were
on the sea in his vicinity.</p>

<p>Roy wondered what his vicinity was. He had
been busy and had not followed the progress of
the ship. But he knew she had been running at
her usual speed, which was about fifteen knots an
hour. They had been at sea but a trifle more
than twenty-four hours. A little figuring told
Roy that the <em>Lycoming</em> was perhaps 425 miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
from New York. Taking a chart from his book
rack and a ruler, he calculated the distance according
to the scale and made a dot on the map.
The <em>Lycoming</em> was off Cape Hatteras, the worst
weather-breeder on our coast and the graveyard
of so many noble ships!</p>

<p>Then Roy did a little more figuring. He knew
the <em>Lycoming</em> was four days from Galveston.
At the same rate of speed, he found by measuring
his map, the <em>Lycoming</em> was perhaps three and
a half days from New Orleans, a little less from
Mobile, and not three days from Tampa. Key
West was a few hours more than two days distant,
and Jacksonville not much more than a
day. Savannah, Charleston, and Wilmington
were within a day’s sail. Northern Cuba was
only a trifle more than two days distant, and various
West Indian ports were but a few hours
further, while the Bahamas were some hours
nearer. From some or all of these ports and a
few others besides, ships might have sailed in time
to bring them close to the <em>Lycoming</em> now. Roy
didn’t know the speed of any of the ships that ply
along the coast excepting the Lycoming’s, but
the captain would know. From his <cite>Herald</cite> clippings
Roy could learn what ships were on the
ocean.</p>

<p>Roy got out his clippings and jotted down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
names of coastwise ships sailing from various
ports in recent days. He believed most of them
would average about the same speed as the <em>Lycoming</em>.
Calculating on that basis, he found that
<em>El Alba</em> from Galveston, the <em>Antilla</em> from Cuba,
the <em>Algonquin</em> from San Domingo, the <em>City of
Columbus</em> from Savannah, the <em>Alabama</em> from
Port Arthur, and the <em>Merrimack</em> from Jacksonville,
all bound north, were now due in the neighborhood
of Hatteras, while the <em>Matinicock</em>, bound
from Baltimore to Tampico, and the <em>Brunswick</em>,
south-bound from Newport News, must be close
ahead in the fog. Now he had something to
go on.</p>

<p>Taking down his signal book, Roy copied the
call signals of each of these vessels. Then he
adjusted his receivers, threw over his switch and
began to call.</p>

<p>“KKL&mdash;KKL&mdash;KKL de WNA,” flashed
Roy’s signal.</p>

<p>Again and again he repeated the call, but no
answer greeted his ear. Either <em>El Alba</em> was not
within hearing distance or else her wireless man
was not at his post.</p>

<p>Roy tried for the <em>Antilla</em>. “KWD&mdash;KWD&mdash;KWD
de WNA,” he rapped out. Then amid
the roar of the storm he waited for an answer.
“KWD&mdash;KWD&mdash;KWD de WNA,” repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Roy after an interval. And this time, very
faintly, he got a reply.</p>

<p>“KWD de WNA. Where are you?” called
Roy. “Are my signals distinct?”</p>

<p>“WNA de KWD,” came the reply. “We
must be about abreast of Cape Fear. Your signals
are very weak.”</p>

<p>“We don’t need to worry about the <em>Antilla</em>,
then,” said Roy to himself. “Cape Fear must
be at least 175 miles south of us.”</p>

<p>Again Roy sent a call flashing from his instrument.
“KVG&mdash;KVG&mdash;KVG de WNA.”</p>

<p>The <em>Algonquin</em> answered promptly. The signals
were very faint. “WNA de KVG. What
do you want?”</p>

<p>“Where are you?” repeated Roy. “We’re
off Hatteras.”</p>

<p>“We touched at Bermuda and left there three
hours ago.”</p>

<p>“Good!” muttered Roy. “That’s another
one out of the road.”</p>

<p>Again he consulted his list and sent forth a
call. “KFA&mdash;KFA&mdash;KFA de WNA.”</p>

<p>The answer came sharp and clear. “WNA
de KFA. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Where are you?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Lost in the fog,” replied the operator on the
<em>City of Columbus</em>. “I don’t know where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
are. We ought to be off Hatteras. Where are
you?”</p>

<p>“Off Hatteras. Are my signals clear?”</p>

<p>“Very sharp.”</p>

<p>“We must be near each other.”</p>

<p>The <em>Alabama</em> did not answer Roy’s call, and
he could get neither of the south-bound ships
ahead of the <em>Lycoming</em>. But the <em>Merrimack</em> replied
so sharply that she was quite evidently near
at hand.</p>

<p>Roy picked up his telephone and called the
captain. No answer came. Again and again
Roy called. Evidently the telephone was out of
order. Roy snatched on his raincoat and cap
and rushed through the rain for the bridge.
Both the captain and Mr. Young were on duty.
Roy thanked his lucky stars that the first officer
was there. Going close to him and cupping his
hands about his mouth, Roy shouted in the big
mate’s ear, “<em>City of Columbus</em> and <em>Merrimack</em>
near us. Been talking to both. They’re looking
for us.”</p>

<p>The first officer nodded and crossed the bridge
to repeat Roy’s report to the captain. Roy
waited lest the captain should have an order.
The latter merely nodded at the mate and peered
into the storm again. Roy went back to the
wireless house, clutching a hand-rail and staggering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
under the wind. He noticed that the ship
was moving at half speed.</p>

<p>Again he called the <em>City of Columbus</em>. The
reply seemed no sharper than before. But when
he signaled the <em>Merrimack</em>, the answer fairly
crackled in his ears. Evidently the two boats
were much nearer to one another.</p>

<p>Roy’s heart began to pound furiously. Were
the two ships about to collide? Was there anything
he could do to prevent it? What should
he do if they did? Sound the SOS of course and
keep sending it until he sank. That was his duty.
He set his teeth. “I’ll do it,” he muttered.
“But there mustn’t be any collision. We must
prevent it. But how?”</p>

<p>Roy’s brow wrinkled. What could he do?
“If only I had a direction finder like the one the
government gave us during the spy hunt,” he
sighed, “I’d locate the <em>Merrimack</em> quick.”</p>

<p>Again he called. “KQM de WNA. How
are my signals now?”</p>

<p>“WNA de KQM. Sharper than ever. We
must be very close.”</p>

<p>“Are you whistling?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Sure. Can’t you hear us? We can hear
you.”</p>

<p>Roy laid down his receivers and opened the
door. Faintly he heard the booming of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
<em>Merrimack’s</em> whistle. Then it came with startling
distinctness. A third time it sounded apparently
in the far, far distance. From what
direction the sound came Roy had not the slightest
idea. The fog now muffled, now magnified
the sound, which seemed to come from nowhere
and everywhere.</p>

<p>An idea flashed into Roy’s head. He leaped
back to his operating table.</p>

<p>“KQM de WNA,” he flashed. “Is there any
way you can signal me and blow your whistle at
the same time?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” came the answer. “The captain and
I will set our watches together and send the two
signals simultaneously. I’ll send three V’s.
Listen.”</p>

<p>Roy sprang up and opened his door, then
leaped back to his operating table. He clamped
on his receivers, laid his watch on the table before
him, and watched it in breathless expectation.</p>

<p>His heart beat like a trip-hammer. The blood
pounded in his brain. His face was flushed with
excitement. Somewhere out there in the fog the
great steamship was rushing toward the <em>Lycoming</em>.
She might be a mile away, she might be
three hundred yards. The two might crash before
ever he heard the signals he was waiting for.
Tense, rigid, yet inwardly aquiver, Roy laid his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
finger on his key, ready to sound the SOS. Then
he listened. For what seemed an age he listened.
The wind shrieked and howled. The <em>Lycoming’s</em>
whistle boomed. The windows rattled. The
rain beat a tattoo on the roof. But no wireless
signal greeted Roy’s ears. He could hardly
hold himself in his chair. Then it came. “V&mdash;V&mdash;V,”
went the signal. Roy noted the position
of the second-hand on his watch and waited
breathlessly for the sound of the <em>Merrimack’s</em>
whistle.</p>

<p>One second passed&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five.</p>

<p>“Mmmmmmmmm!” came the roar of the
<em>Merrimack’s</em> whistle.</p>

<p>“Five seconds,” said Roy. “She’s almost a
mile away. Thank God.”</p>

<p>He pressed his key. Once more blue sparks
leaped in his spark-gap.</p>

<p>“KQM de WNA. Five seconds difference,”
he flashed. “You must be about a mile away.
Try it again.”</p>

<p>“WNA de KQM,” came back the answer.
“Will repeat. Listen.”</p>

<p>Again Roy sat tense, listening for the voice
that meant so much. Again time seemed to stand
still. The wind roared so loud Roy feared he
might not be able to hear the <em>Merrimack’s</em> whistle.
The rain was beating on the roof like the crashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of a thousand drums. His own door was
banging as the ship swayed and lurched, and the
rain drove in in torrents, but Roy dared not close
it. All he could do was to stare at his watch and
listen, listen, listen. He hardly dared breathe.
He was even afraid that the pounding of his
heart would drown out the sounds he was straining
every sense to catch.</p>

<p>Suddenly something snapped in his ear. It
was the <em>Merrimack’s</em> signal, loud as a thunderclap.
Roy jumped in his seat, but kept his eyes
on his watch.</p>

<p>“One second&mdash;two&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Boom!” shrieked the <em>Merrimack’s</em> whistle.</p>

<p>“KQM,” flashed Roy with trembling fingers.
“Reverse. You’re almost on us.” Then he
dropped his receivers and darted into the storm.
Fearlessly he raced across the slippery deck.</p>

<p>“Reverse,” he cried, rushing up to the first
mate. “The <em>Merrimack</em> is almost on us. A
minute ago she was a mile away. Now she’s less
than two thousand feet.”</p>

<p>As though to verify Roy’s words, the hoarse
bellowing roar of the <em>Merrimack’s</em> whistle rang
out deafeningly. The first mate sprang to the
indicator and signaled to the engine room, “Reverse&mdash;full
speed.” The captain leaped for the
whistle cord and the <em>Lycoming</em> shrieked her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
warning. As her propeller reversed, the <em>Lycoming</em>
shivered from stem to stern, heeling far over,
while the water about her was churned into yeasty
foam. She lost headway and began to wallow in
the waves. The captain signaled for the engines
to stop.</p>

<p>“Mmmmmmmmm!” roared the <em>Lycoming’s</em>
whistle as she rolled from side to side.</p>

<p>“Mmmmmmmmm!” came back the awful
echo from the <em>Merrimack</em>.</p>

<p>The two ships were almost on top of each other,
yet neither was visible to the other.</p>

<p>“Mmmmmmmmm!” “Mmmmmmmmm!” they
bellowed at each other.</p>

<p>The captain put his mouth to the first mate’s
ear. “Can you make out where she is?” he
shouted.</p>

<p>“To starboard, I think, sir.”</p>

<p>“So do I.”</p>

<p>The captain beckoned to Roy. “Tell that
ship to stand still while I pass it,” he shouted.</p>

<p>Roy tore back to the wireless house. Water
ran from him in streams as he sat down at his
table.</p>

<p>“KQM de WNA,” he flashed. “Tell your
captain to stand still while we pass.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;go ahead,” came the reply.</p>

<p>Roy scrambled back to the bridge with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
message. The captain turned the handle of the
indicator. Slowly the <em>Lycoming</em> gathered headway.</p>

<p>“Mmmmmmmm!” shrieked her whistle.</p>

<p>“Mmmmmmmm!” answered the <em>Merrimack</em>.</p>

<p>And now there could be no mistaking her position.
She was to starboard and close at hand.
Slowly the <em>Lycoming</em> crept around her, then went
nosing her way through the fog again. Once
Roy thought he glimpsed the <em>Merrimack</em> but he
was not sure. When her whistle was plainly
astern, Roy again shot a message to her wireless
man.</p>

<p>“Close shave,” he flashed. “Thanks for your
help.”</p>

<p>“You saved us from a collision, sure,” came
back the answer. “Good-bye and good luck to
you.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the two boats were miles
apart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ROY GAINS ANOTHER FRIEND</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">On went the <em>Lycoming</em>, creeping cautiously
through the fog. For hours Roy sat at his
instrument and kept in touch with the steamers he
had already talked to. Again he went over his
newspaper file and searched out all the other
ships recorded that by any possibility at all could
be near the <em>Lycoming</em>. One by one he flung out
their call signals. Some he heard at a far distance,
some he could not reach at all. From
time to time he talked with the <em>City of Columbus</em>,
but she was still afar off. When he had thoroughly
combed the air with his wireless signals,
Roy breathed more freely. He felt certain that
no steamer was in the <em>Lycoming’s</em> path or in her
immediate neighborhood. The only thing that
remained to fear was some silent sailing ship that
might suddenly come plunging out of the mist
bank. Roy hoped the time would soon come
when every ship afloat would be compelled to
carry wireless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly the fog lifted as mysteriously as it
had come. The rain ceased. The wind fell
somewhat, but still continued high. Roy looked
at his watch and was surprised to see that they
had been in the fog-bank for more than eight
hours. It was night. Roy had not even been
conscious that he had missed his supper. Now
he was suddenly so hungry he felt as though he
could eat nails. The dining-room was closed.
Roy punched the bell for the steward. When
the latter appeared, Roy said, “Sam, could you
get a fellow a bite to eat? We’ve been so busy
up here that I clean forgot to go to supper.”</p>

<p>Now Roy remembered that he was wet.
Every garment he had on was sopping with
moisture. Puddles of water had gathered under
his chair. His operating table was soaked. His
chair held a little pool of water. He had been
hot with excitement and had not been conscious
of his wet clothes. Now he threw off his clammy
garments, rubbed himself briskly, and pulled on
dry clothes. Just as he finished, Sam returned
with a pot of steaming coffee, an enormous quantity
of sandwiches, some freshly boiled eggs, and
a big piece of pie.</p>

<p>“That sure looks good to me,” said Roy, as he
reached for a sandwich. “I am much obliged to
you, Sam.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, suh. We all is mighty
grateful to you fo’ what you done fo’ de ship.”
And Sam disappeared through the doorway,
grinning.</p>

<p>Roy’s heart leaped with joy. At last he had
won recognition. Then he wondered how Sam
knew about the occurrence. Perhaps he had only
guessed what had happened. Yet Roy knew
that could not be. Some one must have reported
the occurrence and that some one could be only
the captain or Mr. Young. Roy was certain it
was not the captain. It did not matter to Roy
who told it. Whoever did had considered Roy’s
service as meritorious or he would not have mentioned
it. Roy felt that there was no doubt that
recognition had come to him. He resolved to be
very careful not to mention the matter himself
lest he seem boastful.</p>

<p>After all, Roy asked himself, had he done anything
remarkable? He had merely made use of
his knowledge of scientific principles. The captain,
who had sailed the sea for a generation and
faced countless storms and fogs without ever
losing a man or a ship, had done a million times
more. That thought was both sobering and
wholesome. It helped Roy to see matters in
their proper light. If anybody spoke to him now
about the matter he was in no danger of getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
a “swelled head.” Compared to the captain he
felt very insignificant indeed.</p>

<p>It was well that these sobering thoughts came
to Roy so soon, for very shortly afterward Mr.
Young stalked into the wireless house. He had
seldom visited Roy there and Roy was happy to
see him. He was happier still when Mr. Young
walked over to the operating table, studied the instruments
intently, and, turning to Roy, demanded,
“How did you do that, Mr. Mercer?”</p>

<p>“Do what?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Find out how close that ship was? To begin
with, how did you know she was near?”</p>

<p>“I was never in a big fog before,” said Roy,
“but I saw at once that the ship was in a dangerous
situation. I wondered what I could do to
help. I knew that at least I could figure out
what ships were in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“How?” said the mate, much interested.</p>

<p>“You see,” explained Roy, “I have kept a
file of the <cite>Herald</cite> shipping news ever since I
joined the <em>Lycoming</em>. That gave me the names
of the ships of any size that have sailed from various
ports in the last few days. I made a list of
them. Here it is.”</p>

<p>Roy handed the list to Mr. Young, who looked
at it with interest.</p>

<p>“Then I tried to figure out which ones would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
be due in our neighborhood. I didn’t know how
fast any of them traveled, but you can bet your
boots that hereafter I’m going to learn the speed
of every ship we pass. I figured they would all
go at about our rate&mdash;fifteen knots. Then I
worked out the distances from all the ports south
of us, including Cuban and West Indian ports,
and reckoned what ships should be near us.
When I had found that out, I began calling them.
Only one of them seemed to be very close&mdash;the
<em>Merrimack</em>.”</p>

<p>“How could you determine that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I knew we were off Hatteras, and most
of the ships I talked with knew where they were.
But the <em>Merrimack</em> was lost in the fog and her
wireless man didn’t know where he was.”</p>

<p>“Then how did you know she was near?”</p>

<p>“By the wireless signals. They were so loud
and distinct that I knew she was close at
hand.”</p>

<p>“But how could you tell that she was five thousand
feet away at one time and a little later only
two thousand feet? That’s what puzzles me. I
never heard of anything like it before.”</p>

<p>“It was this way,” explained Roy. “When I
got into touch with her wireless man, he asked if
we could hear the <em>Merrimack’s</em> whistle. He said
they could distinctly hear ours. At least he supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
it was ours. I listened and heard the
whistle, but one time it seemed near and again
far off. I couldn’t tell from what direction the
sound came.”</p>

<p>“Correct,” said Mr. Young. “We heard it,
too. Fog does the strangest things to sound.
That’s what makes it so dangerous for ships.
The officer in charge can usually hear another
ship, but sometimes he can’t for the life of him
tell what direction the sound comes from.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Roy, “it occurred to me
that if the <em>Merrimack’s</em> whistle and her wireless
instrument could signal at the same instant I
could tell how far away she was.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked the first mate, more interested
than ever.</p>

<p>“Why, you know, Mr. Young, electricity is instantaneous,
while it takes sound a second to
travel a thousand feet. If the two signals started
together, I could time the difference between their
arrivals. It was simple enough if only the <em>Merrimack</em>
could send the signals right.”</p>

<p>“Now what do you think of that?” cried the
mate. “How did you manage it?”</p>

<p>“The <em>Merrimack’s</em> wireless man did that. I
asked him if he could. He said he would talk to
the captain and they would set their watches together
and each signal at the same instant. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
I had to do was listen to the signals and catch the
time between them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be darned!” ejaculated the first
mate. “I never heard anything like it. Is that
what they teach you at the radio school?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never been to one,” said Roy. “All I
know about wireless I picked up myself.”</p>

<p>The first officer regarded Roy with astonishment.
“Well, you’re a pippin,” he said.</p>

<p>Roy laughed. “A little while ago,” he replied,
“I thought I would soon be a fish. When
the <em>Merrimack</em> signaled a second time and there
was only two seconds’ difference between her
radio and her whistle, I thought it was all up
with us. I signaled her to reverse and raced out
to you on the bridge. You know the rest.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Mercer,” said the first mate, as he rose
to go, “I’m going to tell the captain every word
of this. He has never thought very much of
wireless, because he always said, ‘What good is
it? It won’t tell you where you are, or where the
other fellow is. And when you’re in a fog those
are the only things a skipper wants to know.’
But it seems that in the right hands it will answer
both questions.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be in a hurry,” said Roy, trying to
change the subject. “Have a bite to eat. Sam
just brought me this stuff. The coffee’s piping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
hot. You must be tired to death. You’ve been
on the bridge more than twelve hours straight.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said the mate. “A cup of hot
coffee and a sandwich <em>would</em> taste good, if it
won’t be robbing you.”</p>

<p>They sat and talked for half an hour, munching
sandwiches as they conversed. When Mr.
Young finally went to his own quarters, Roy felt
as though they had been friends for years. Their
brief comradeship in danger had made their
friendship real. Roy felt this so keenly that as
his big visitor rose to go, he said, “I wish you
would call me Roy when we’re alone, and not
Mr. Mercer. You know I’m not used to being
called Mister yet and I’d rather not have my
friends use that handle when they talk to me.”</p>

<p>“All right, Roy. Good-night and my hearty
thanks for your help to-day.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A TRIP TO THE OIL FIELDS</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Without further incident of note, the
<em>Lycoming</em> ran on down the Atlantic coast,
passed through the Florida Straits, and bore
straight across the Gulf to her destination.
When she was safely docked and the process of
unloading well under way, the big mate one day
mounted the ladder to the wireless house.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Roy,” he said. “How would
you like to take a little trip over to the oil fields?
I have to go over there for the captain and I’d
be glad to take you along.”</p>

<p>“How far is it, and how long will it take?”
inquired Roy.</p>

<p>“About sixty miles, I suppose. It will likely
take us two hours to run over.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Roy. “I’ll be mighty glad
to go. I have never seen an oil-well.”</p>

<p>They ferried across the bay to Port Bolivar
and there took a train for the oil fields. Soon
Roy was very glad indeed that he had come.
Everything was different from what he was accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to at home. The country was low and
level. Nowhere was there an elevation that
could be called a hill. In the open spaces he
could see for miles and miles over the flat land.
His view in this direction was almost as unlimited
as it was on the ocean. To Roy, accustomed as
he was to hills and mountains, this flat land
seamed monotonous and uninteresting. In
places he saw herds of cattle on these open
reaches, and cowboys galloping on horseback.
For a considerable stretch Roy and his comrade
rode over the bare, level prairie. Then they
came to some bits of woodland.</p>

<p>“I never realized before,” said Roy, “how
beautiful trees are. Look at that fine grove over
there.”</p>

<p>“Down here they call a grove like that a
motte,” rejoined Roy’s companion with a smile.</p>

<p>“A what?” ejaculated Roy in astonishment.</p>

<p>“A motte. It means a little grove of trees in
a prairie.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a new one to me,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“You’ll run into lots more things that seem
strange,” said the mate. “You know you’re a
long way from home. If you were in Europe,
you’d be in a foreign land at this distance from
your home.”</p>

<p>“Well, I see something already that’s new.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
What ails the trees in that ‘motte’? They look
as if somebody had hung veils or something on
them.”</p>

<p>The first officer laughed. “You aren’t so far
out of the way, Roy,” he said, “only what you
see is moss, and it was hung there by nature.”</p>

<p>“Moss!” exclaimed Roy. “Why, I never
saw any moss like that. The stuff must be a
yard long.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and it’s moss. They call it Spanish
moss, and sometimes it is known as pirate’s beard.
It often grows three feet long. In this part of
the world the trees are festooned with it. After
a while we’ll take a walk through a wood where
it grows thick, and you’ll agree with me that it
is very beautiful.”</p>

<p>The train passed a number of ranch-houses, or
rather a number were visible at a distance. They
were little, low structures, painted a dazzling
white. There was little or no shade about them,
and it seemed to Roy as though they must be unendurably
hot, out there on the open prairie with
the blazing Texas sun beating down on them.
Several of these ranch-houses had curious, low
trees near them that spread out horizontally like
enormous umbrellas. They caught Roy’s eye at
once.</p>

<p>“What are those funny trees?” he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“Those are China-trees, Roy. They have
quantities of colored berries on them in the winter
season, the juice of which is intoxicating. Young
robins often eat the berries and get drunk. Then
they can be knocked over with a stick, and, in
consequence, many poor young robins go into
potpies down here. It is said that a robin that
has once been intoxicated by the berries will never
touch them a second time, but I don’t know how
true it is.”</p>

<p>The railroad crossed several small streams.
Along the course of each were luxuriant growths
of trees. Some of these were quite unfamiliar to
Roy. One species in particular caught his attention
because of its dark, glossy foliage.</p>

<p>“That is the live-oak,” explained Mr. Young.
“It is really an evergreen, although it has leaves
like our deciduous trees.”</p>

<p>In about two hours the train drew near the oil
fields. Mr. Young did not have to tell Roy
where they were, for Roy’s nose told him very
plainly. The air was redolent with crude oil.</p>

<p>“Phew!” cried Roy. “That’s pretty strong.
I don’t believe I would like to live in such a
smell.”</p>

<p>“You’d soon get used to it,” replied the mate.
“A person can get used to anything, apparently,
though I’ve sometimes wondered how anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
could ever become accustomed to the smell of the
factories where they turn fish into oil and fertilizer.
I was in one once near the Delaware Breakwater.”</p>

<p>“If it smelled any worse than this,” laughed
Roy, “I’m glad it’s near the Delaware Breakwater.
That’s quite close enough for me.”</p>

<p>When they got out of the train they walked
toward the oil field. Roy had seen pictures of
the Pennsylvania oil fields, which were hardly a
hundred miles from his home. He expected to
see a derrick here and a derrick there, and so he
was utterly amazed at what he now beheld. Oil-derricks
rose before him in dense masses. From
a distance it seemed to Roy that they were as
close together as trees in a forest. There were
hundreds and hundreds of them. Instead of being
spread out all over the region they were
crowded together. Mr. Young explained that
this was because the oil pocket was in that particular
neighborhood. As they drew nearer,
they could see the pumps at work, the walking-beams
going rhythmically up and down.</p>

<p>But what amazed Roy perhaps even more than
the mass of derricks were the colonies of tanks to
hold the oil. In every direction were clusters of
tanks. These were great, circular structures of
steel, each holding 30,000 gallons or more. Roy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
noticed that each group of tanks was laid out with
mathematical precision, like checkers standing at
even distances from one another on a checker-board.
The idea was emphasized by the fact that
each tank had a dike or low wall of earth thrown
up about it in the form of a great square, like the
lines in the checker-board. Roy asked why the
dikes were there.</p>

<p>“Sometimes an oil-tank catches fire,” said Mr.
Young, “and the burning oil gets out. If there
is a dike about a tank the burning oil can’t reach
the tanks next to it and set them on fire.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good idea,” commented Roy.</p>

<p>“If ever you see a tank afire, you’ll think so,”
said Mr. Young. “Sometimes a tank explodes
and showers burning oil all about. A tank will
burn for days, and the entire field is endangered
as long as the blaze lasts. Everything about an
oil field is soaked with oil, you will notice, and
if a fire spreads, it may sweep over the entire
field. That has happened more than once.
Whenever a tank gets afire, they begin at once to
pump the oil out of the tanks around it.”</p>

<p>Presently Roy caught sight of a great string of
tank-cars. “Jiminy crickets!” he exclaimed.
“I didn’t know there were so many oil cars in the
country. Why, there must be hundreds of
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose there are,” answered Mr. Young.
“Do you see those racks running along the
tracks just beside the cars? Those are huge oil
pipes. They connect with oil-tanks somewhere.
When a train is to be filled, a connecting pipe is
run out to each tank-car and the pumps are
started. They can load a hundred cars as easily
as one.”</p>

<p>Presently a man on a buckboard dashed toward
them, crying, “Here’s your hot tamales. Just
fresh out of the kettle.”</p>

<p>“Have you eaten a hot tamale, Roy?” asked
Mr. Young.</p>

<p>“No,” said Roy. “I didn’t know they were
things you ate. I thought that was just a slang
term.”</p>

<p>Mr. Young laughed and said, “We’ll try some.
Then you’ll know what that bit of slang means.”</p>

<p>He motioned to the vender, who raced over to
them and pulled his horses up short. They were
bronchos and interested Roy. They were small
but apparently tough and wiry. Mr. Young
bought two tamales and handed one to Roy. The
latter looked at it quizzically. He didn’t know
whether he was the victim of a joke or not; for
what Mr. Young had given him was a piece of a
corn-husk. It was piping hot, and was wrapped
around something soft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Open it,” said Mr. Young.</p>

<p>Roy carefully unrolled the husk. Within was
the steaming tamale. It was a little cake of meal
and minced meat, cooked in the husk. Roy took
a bite. There were tears in his eyes before he
got it down.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar!” he cried, “what’s in that?”</p>

<p>“Corn-meal, minced meat, cayenne pepper,
and perhaps some other things,” said Mr. Young.</p>

<p>“Principally pepper, I think,” said Roy, sucking
in fresh air to cool his burning mouth. Then,
after a moment, he laughed. “I certainly do
know what that slang term means,” he said.
“Whoever invented that dish, anyway?”</p>

<p>“The Mexicans,” said Mr. Young. “There
are a lot more Mexican dishes you may want to
try while you’re down here&mdash;enchiladas and chili
con carne, for instance.”</p>

<p>“Not for mine,” said Roy ruefully. “At least
not if they are anything like hot tamales.”</p>

<p>“They are,” laughed the first officer, “only
more so. That’s one thing I never could understand&mdash;why
people in a country as hot as Mexico
should want to eat food as hot and greasy as the
Mexicans like it, for they use about as much lard
as they do pepper.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I’m not a Mexican,” laughed Roy.</p>

<p>They walked through the oil field to the headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of a drilling company. Mr. Young
transacted the business on which he had come.
Roy, meantime, wandered about, watching operations.
He was particularly interested in the
digging of a great, round hollow near by. Hundreds
of men were at work in it, and scores of
mules. With scrapers the men were hollowing
out a great circle and dragging the scooped-out
earth up in a mound that ran around it.</p>

<p>“What are they doing?” asked Roy when
Mr. Young rejoined him.</p>

<p>“Building an earthen tank for oil,” replied the
mate. “They will lay planks to form the circular
wall and back that up with the earth in the
mound. The roof will be of boards. The tank
will hold several hundred gallons and will be
pretty much under ground. It’s a cheap way to
build a reservoir and it makes a pretty safe receptacle.
Now we’ll go look at that bit of woods
I mentioned.”</p>

<p>They left the oil field and walked toward a
woodland that was visible at some distance. It
proved to be extensive and lay along a little
stream of water. Roy was instantly attracted
by the wonderful growths of pirate’s beard. It
was everywhere. In great festoons it hung from
the trees, giving the woods a misty, hazy look.
Roy got hold of some and examined it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
moss was like coarse, gray-green fibres more or
less loosely grown together. It reminded him of
an old man’s beard and he thought it was well
named.</p>

<p>He admired the live-oaks with their picturesque
growth and beautiful leaves, so green and glossy.
Here and there great bunches of mistletoe with
its yellow-green stems and leaves caught his eye.
But what pleased Roy most were the beautiful
holly-trees. There were none in his part of the
country, but he had seen holly branches in the
stores at Christmas time and he instantly knew
what they were. There were no red berries on
the trees at this season, but they were beautiful
even without the berries, with their smooth, gray
trunks that reminded Roy of the beeches in his
own neighborhood, and the glossy, dark green
leaves, with their prickly edges. There were
many other strange and interesting growths, and
Roy went back to the train feeling that he had
been richly repaid for his journey.</p>

<p>The return trip was made without incident and
in due time Roy and his friend found themselves
back on the <em>Lycoming</em>. Captain Lansford
nodded to them as they came aboard and inquired
pleasantly if Roy had enjoyed the trip. Roy
answered briefly, then went to the wireless house.
His heart was beating high. The captain had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
never said one word to him concerning the fog
and the part Roy had played in helping to prevent
a collision, but ever since that event he had
seemed different to Roy. His greeting now
made Roy feel that perhaps at last he was making
some headway in his struggle to win the captain’s
good-will. At any rate, he felt sure that
the captain no longer disliked him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SOS</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">But Roy was soon to find that the captain’s
favor, like success, could be gained by no
royal road. It was true that the captain’s feeling
toward Roy was perhaps altered somewhat,
but not nearly so much as Roy either hoped or at
first believed. The captain treated him less
coldly than before, but there was nothing like
cordiality in his manner toward Roy. Distinctly
the captain’s attitude was like that of the
man from Missouri. He still wanted to be shown.</p>

<p>It was a long time before Roy grasped the idea
that the captain was still skeptical concerning the
desirability of wireless. But as time and distance
from the <em>Merrimack</em> incident gave him a
saner view of the affair, he came to understand
the captain’s point of view. That was that
though Roy had possibly been helpful in averting
a collision, it did not by any means follow that if
Roy had not been aboard a collision would have
occurred. The men on the bridge plainly heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the <em>Merrimack’s</em> whistle. They knew she was
near and coming closer. They were straining
every nerve and sense to prevent an accident.
All that Roy had told them that they did not already
know was the fact that the <em>Merrimack</em> was
within two thousand feet. And they might have
guessed even that. When Roy, after much deliberation,
had reasoned this out for himself, he
saw his own part in a new light. It seemed to
him now very commonplace and inconsequential.
Perhaps he now erred as much in this new opinion
as previously he had erred in overestimating his
accomplishment.</p>

<p>But at any rate his new point of view helped
him. More and more, as he saw new crises arising,
now over delays in loading, now over breaks
in machinery or equipment, now through storms
or other superhuman causes, and saw the captain
rise superior to one after another of these obstacles,
he got his true bearings. He understood
what a really insignificant place he occupied.
For thirty years the captain had wrestled, and
wrestled triumphantly, with every form of obstacle
known to the mariner, while he, Roy, had
sailed the seas hardly more than thirty days and
knew nothing of the thousand difficulties of
navigation.</p>

<p>It was fortunate indeed for Roy that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
thus come to understand his true situation. It
prevented him, on the one hand, from becoming
conceited, and so ruining his chances of ever
getting ahead; and, on the other hand, it kept him
from growing sullen and becoming indifferent in
his work. And while it could hardly have been
called encouraging, it was far from being discouraging.
For Roy’s entire experience of life
made him believe firmly that if he worked hard
enough and used his brains along with his hands,
nothing could keep him from succeeding. The
net result of all his cogitations, therefore, was to
make him grit his teeth the tighter and vow in
his heart that nothing should prevent him from
winning out. He would do perfectly every task
that could possibly be required of him.</p>

<p>Week after week went by with no noticeable
alteration in the captain’s attitude toward Roy.
The captain spoke to him politely but without
cordiality. He never came to the wireless house
and he never invited Roy to the bridge, or the
wheel-house, or his own cabin. He sent no messages
other than those required by his work. He
never asked for weather-reports or storm warnings,
or the nightly news-letter, though Roy unfailingly
laid these before the captain. But
whether the latter welcomed them or took any
interest in them Roy could not discover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>All the while Roy continued to pick up useful
information. He got acquainted with every
member of the crew. He learned exactly how a
ship is coaled and how the coal is stored in the
bunkers. Often he visited the fire-room and the
water-tenders explained to him exactly how fires
should be handled. He watched the crew load
and unload the ship and soon found that if the
cargo was to be stowed in such a manner that it
would not shift in a storm and endanger the ship,
it must be packed with fine skill. Harder than
ever he tried to make himself agreeable to the
passengers, for he bore ever in mind the fact that
it was his duty to get as much business for the
company as he could.</p>

<p>Meantime, Roy matured rapidly. All his
pleasing frankness and his jolly good nature he
retained. More and more he grew dependable.
Before many weeks passed everybody aboard the
<em>Lycoming</em>, from the captain down, understood
that if Roy said he would do a thing or if he
were ordered to do a thing, that thing would be
done, and done promptly and well. Roy hardly
realized what a reputation he had gained. And
even if he had, it is hardly likely that he would
have appreciated the full importance of such a
reputation. Though he knew in his heart that
any real success must be based on just such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
reputation for trustworthiness, he was constantly
on the lookout for an opportunity to prove his
merit in ways more striking. The opportunity
came to Roy far sooner than he ever believed it
would and in a way it would have terrified him to
contemplate, could he have foreseen all that lay
before him.</p>

<p>Early September found Roy on his last voyage
aboard the <em>Lycoming</em>. At least he believed it to
be his last. The three months’ period during
which a possible successor was being prepared for
his position was almost at an end. The captain
had given no indication that he thought more
highly of Roy or that he desired him to continue
at his post. Neither had he ever mentioned, after
their first interview, the probability of a successor
for Roy. But Roy understood that he
would not. The new man would simply come
aboard and Roy would be told to report to the
Marconi office. What would happen to him then
he did not know. He hated to think of the day
when this would happen, for it might mean the
end of his career as a Marconi operator. More
than that, it would certainly mean an end to his
relations with the purser and the first mate and
all the other friends who had been so good to
him on the <em>Lycoming</em>, and of whom he had become
so fond. So it was with a rather heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
heart that he put to sea early in September on
what he believed would be his very last trip
aboard the <em>Lycoming</em>. It was hard to keep a
stiff upper lip and to continue smiling. But Roy
took a grip on himself and made the effort.</p>

<p>Apparently the journey was to be as uneventful
as the last few trips had been. Two days
passed without incident. Then the barometer
began to fall. Roy did not know that, but he
had grown sufficiently weather-wise to know that
a storm was brewing. At first he thought little
of it. The captain’s face, as usual, was inscrutable,
but Mr. Young looked sober. When Roy
noticed that he began to feel concerned. Then
he remembered that it was the ninth of September&mdash;the
very period of the year when the worst
storms visit the Gulf.</p>

<p>The <em>Lycoming</em> was already far down the
Florida coast. The Bahama Islands were just
ahead. The passage between Palm Beach and
the Great Bahama Island was hardly sixty miles
wide&mdash;a mere nothing in a storm, should anything
go wrong. Only a few hours distant were the
Florida Straits, with their treacherous currents
and their far-flung string of keys, like a chain to
catch the unwary mariner, with Key West like
a pendant at the end of the chain, and the Dry
Tortugas still farther west. Perilous indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
would be the position of any ship overtaken
thereabout by a hurricane.</p>

<p>Roy inspected his apparatus, made sure his
telephone was in working order, and got ready
for an emergency. Late in the day Roy went
on the bridge to talk to Mr. Young, who was in
command. Already there were signs of the coming
storm. The wind was soughing ominously
and rising steadily. The sea was beginning to
heave. The <em>Lycoming</em> rolled unsteadily. Roy
thanked his lucky stars that he had gotten his sea-legs
and could stand rough weather without being
seasick. He might be needed and he wanted
to be fit if he were.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Looks bad to me,” said the first officer.
“The barometer is falling fast. Something is
sure to come out of it. And now’s just the time
of year when the worst storms hit the Gulf. If
we can get past the Dry Tortugas before it strikes
us, we’ll be all right. We’ll have the entire Gulf
before us then.”</p>

<p>“What does the captain think of it?” inquired
Roy.</p>

<p>“He never says much about what he thinks,”
replied the big mate, “but he’s had his eye on the
barometer all the forenoon, and he’s asleep now,
so it’s evident what he thinks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mean he thinks there’s nothing to worry
about?”</p>

<p>“I mean just the contrary. If we do have a
bad storm, the captain will be out here on the
bridge until it’s over or until he can’t stand any
longer, and he’s resting up.”</p>

<p>Roy returned to the wireless house, feeling
vaguely uneasy.</p>

<p>Palm Beach was passed early in the afternoon.
Roy saw that even at her best speed the <em>Lycoming</em>
could hardly reach the Straits before midnight,
and it would be close to ten hours more before
they were safely past the Dry Tortugas.
Twenty hours must elapse before they were
through the danger zone and had the wide Gulf
before them. He hoped that the storm would
hold off that length of time.</p>

<p>Sunset saw little change in the weather.
Wind and wave were far from boisterous. The
thing that troubled the first officer was the way
in which the barometer still fell steadily. Late
in the day he gave an order to make everything
fast. Roy, chancing to come out of the wireless
house, saw sailors below battening down hatches,
lashing every movable object fast, and otherwise
making things tight. He had never seen that
done before. At supper Roy noticed that the
waiters were serious and preoccupied. Somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
a distinct air of apprehension seemed to be
abroad. And yet there was nothing to be alarmed
at excepting the steady fall of the barometer.</p>

<p>Roy went directly from the supper table to his
instrument and began searching the seas for
ships. The atmosphere played all sorts of tricks
with his wireless. One minute he could hear
nothing and the next he would catch part of a
message from New York. He got into touch
with the Mallory liner <em>Comal</em>. She was anchored
at Key West. He heard the steamer
<em>Valbanera</em> and talked with her. She was off
Havana. A terrible storm was raging there and
the ship’s master was afraid to try to enter the
harbor. So he had put to sea again. Once Roy
heard a message sent by the <em>Empress</em> to some
other ship. The <em>Empress</em> had left Havana for
Galveston, a new schedule having gone into
effect.</p>

<p>“The captain will see his brother this voyage,”
thought Roy. “It will be a happy trip for him.”</p>

<p>He tried to reach the <em>Empress</em>, but call as he
would, he could get no response. He talked with
a number of shore stations, but there seemed to
be nothing out of the ordinary to report. The
sea was not very rough and the chances of getting
nicely through the Straits seemed good. Yet
Roy could not help feeling apprehensive and depressed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
He knew the Gulf was in a tumult off
Havana. Could he have seen the barometer and
the sober face of Captain Lansford, who had now
taken command, he would have known there was
good cause to feel apprehensive.</p>

<p>Just when the storm struck the <em>Lycoming</em>, Roy
never knew. Hour after hour he stuck to the
wireless house, now listening in, now calling, calling
for ships he knew ought to be within call, but
which he could not reach. So intent was Roy
upon his work that he did not hear the rising wind
or notice the increasing violence of the waves,
until suddenly the <em>Lycoming</em> staggered and
heeled far over. The sudden lurch almost threw
Roy out of his chair.</p>

<p>He pulled off his receivers and was instantly
aware that the wind was shrieking about the wireless
house with terrific force. The windows
rattled, the door creaked under its pressure, and
the entire superstructure of the ship seemed to
shiver. He could hear the groaning of masts and
derricks, of life-boats and rafts lashed to the deck,
of a hundred objects here and there. He thanked
providence the mate had had things made fast.
The roll of the rain on the roof was like thunder.
When Roy rose to his feet he found he could not
stand without holding to something. At once he
knew he had never been in such a storm as this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
But it was not until he opened the door of the
wireless house that he understood how violent the
storm really was. The instant he turned the latch
the door flew inward, striking him with great
force. The wind rushed in with a deafening
shriek and almost flung him on the floor. The
rain beat in in torrents. The roar of the elements
was beyond description. It was a deafening
welter of sound. Like demons howling in
agony the winds roared and shrieked. The rain
beat a terrific monotone on deck and roof. The
crests of the waves broke before the wind with a
hissing roar like the thunder of a thousand
Niagaras. The rigging rattled. Woodwork
everywhere creaked and groaned. Stays and
guy lines beat a very devil’s tattoo under the
awful blasts. All about him, papers, despatches,
records, clothes, were whirling like dust before a
swirling wind. With all his might Roy strove
to shut the door. He was not able to do it. Then
an awful lurch of the ship flung the door violently
shut and threw Roy against the opposite wall.
His chair flew across the room with a crash. The
remainder of the furniture was fastened to the
floor.</p>

<p>Roy picked himself up, righted his chair, and
attempted to collect the articles scattered by the
wind. Now he realized how the sea had risen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Down, down, down, the ship seemed to go. It
lifted as suddenly, sending Roy staggering
against the wall. Now it lurched this way, now
that. Never had he supposed a great ship could
be pitched about as the <em>Lycoming</em> now was.
Far to one side it tilted. As suddenly it shot far
to the other side. Then it pitched forward.
Now it seemed as though it was trying to stand
on its stern. Suddenly it dipped sidewise, falling,
falling, until Roy cried out in very fear.
He was sure the ship was turning over. Nor
was his the only heart that stood still with terror.
White-faced the man in the pilot-house clung to
his wheel.</p>

<p>“Great God!” he muttered. “A sixty-degree
roll,” and waited breathless, like Roy, for
the ship to right itself.</p>

<p>Down in the stewards’ quarters the negroes
were gathered together with blanched faces,
some praying, some moaning. Amid all this
welter of wind and wave, Captain Lansford stood
on the bridge, holding to the rail like grim death,
the rain falling on his oilskins in torrents, the
blasts tearing at his garments, as he peered
through the blinding spray and listened to the
tumult of the tempest, unmoved, immovable, a
man of iron with a heart of steel, grappling with
a tempest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the thought of the captain that brought
courage back to Roy. As the <em>Lycoming</em> hung
for what seemed an age at that terrifying angle,
Roy lost his grip on himself. For perhaps the
first time in his life, he felt physical terror. An
awful fear gripped his soul. His heart actually
stopped beating. The blood rushed from his
cheeks till they were like chalk. He seemed
paralyzed. He could not even cry out. He
was completely unmanned. Death was so near
at hand and the thought of it came so suddenly
that it overpowered him. Then Roy thought of
the captain. He knew he was out on the bridge.
He knew he was facing the awful wind, the driving
rain, the blinding spray, the danger of being
washed overboard, and that there he would stand,
hour after hour defying death and the elements
to bring the <em>Lycoming</em> safe to port.</p>

<p>“Thank God for Captain Lansford!” cried
Roy. “He’ll win through. He’ll bring us safe
to port. He’s never failed yet. He won’t fail
now. Thank God, Captain Lansford is in command.”</p>

<p>The color flew back into Roy’s cheeks. His
heart began to pound bravely. His pulses beat
with courage.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to help him, every one of us!” he
cried aloud. “What can I do? What can I do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>A still, small voice answered, “Your duty.”</p>

<p>“My duty,” said Roy aloud, “is right at that
instrument. That’s my post as long as this storm
lasts.”</p>

<p>He shoved his chair across the room, sat down
at his desk, and clamped the receivers to his ears.
He was just in time to catch a message. The
United States Weather Bureau at New Orleans,
seven hundred miles away, was sending out a
storm warning to Louisiana coast towns and
other places along the Gulf which the hurricane
had not yet reached. “Tropical disturbance in
southeastern Gulf moving northwest will cause
increasing northeast winds.”</p>

<p>According to rule, Roy jotted down the time
the message was received. It was just ten
o’clock.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I should give this to the captain,”
said Roy, with a grin. “He might like to know
there’s going to be a storm.”</p>

<p>Then his face became sober enough and he
settled to work. For long periods he listened for
voices in the storm. Again and again he flashed
out messages to ships that he thought should be
near, but he could reach nobody. After a time
he got an answer from the <em>Comal</em>, with which he
had talked before. She was still fast to her
moorings in Key West, but in imminent danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of being torn away. Even as Roy talked to her
it happened.</p>

<p>“We’re loose,” flashed her operator to Roy,
“and blowing ashore. I’ve got to stand by to
send messages for the skipper. Good-bye.
Good luck to you.”</p>

<p>There were tears in Roy’s eyes as he jotted
down the message. “Wishing us good luck
while he’s going perhaps to his death,” muttered
Roy. “He’s a man&mdash;as every wireless operator
ought to be.” And while he listened for other
signals, he sent up a silent prayer that when the
pinch came he would be equally brave.</p>

<p>Meantime the ship staggered on. With the
stars blotted out, with the seas mounting higher
and higher, with the wind blowing at hurricane
force, it was impossible to tell what speed the ship
was making, whether she was being blown far
from her course, or where she was. Yet the captain
must decide all these things and decide them
right, if the <em>Lycoming</em> was to come through the
storm in safety. The most hazardous part of her
journey still lay ahead of her. It would be
doubly hazardous now because the wind would
be abeam when she turned west to pass through
the Straits.</p>

<p>In the early hours of the morning the motion
of the ship seemed to alter. For Roy, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
very top of the vessel, every movement was intensified.
At once he was conscious of this
altered motion. Before, her movements had
been mostly violent forward plunges. Now she
rolled fearfully from side to side. First she
rolled far over to port. Then she dipped at a
terrifying angle to starboard. Roy could not
understand it. After a time it came to him that
the ship was wallowing in the trough of the
waves. Had something gone wrong? Had the
steering-gear broken? Was the ship out of control
and drifting toward land, even as the <em>Comal</em>
had done? These and a hundred other questions
Roy asked himself as he sat breathless at his operating
table. Should he call the bridge to see if
the captain wanted the SOS sounded? Small
chance they would have of getting help in such a
storm, Roy told himself, when it was all any ship
could do to keep herself afloat, let alone help another.
All the while Roy was conscious of the
regular vibration of the ship’s engines. Presently
it occurred to him that if the ship were unmanageable
the engines would probably be
stopped. Then he knew what was wrong. The
ship had turned west. They were in the Straits.
The waves were catching the <em>Lycoming</em> abeam.
The pinch had come. Could the <em>Lycoming</em> survive
it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly had Roy asked himself the question before
there was an awful roar. With a noise like
a thousand thunders a mighty sea struck the <em>Lycoming</em>
broadside and poured over her decks. It
was the first sea that had come aboard. By intuition
Roy knew what had happened. His
thoughts reverted to the day when he had expressed
surprise, almost incredulity, at the purser’s
statement that waves sometimes swept the
deck. Thirty feet, the purser had said the waves
sometimes rose. He wondered how high this
one was. He knew it was a monster. He wondered
what the sea looked like with waves like
that. He wished it were day so he could see.
Then he was glad it was not day. He was afraid
he would be afraid. Whatever happened, he did
not want to be a coward. The thought of the
captain on the bridge heartened him. It was
wonderful how the bare thought of that fearless
man restored Roy’s courage.</p>

<p>On and on plunged the <em>Lycoming</em>, ploughing
through cross-seas, wallowing between mighty
waves, fighting her way through a welter of water
such as Roy had never dreamed of. Hour
by hour, the force of the wind increased. The
seas mounted higher. The ship labored more
heavily. Time and again great waves swept
over her. Her bulwarks were smashed. Railings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and woodwork were torn away. Iron
stanchions were bent like wire. The bridge was
battered. The waters clawed at her hull and the
winds tore at her superstructure. But unflinching,
unyielding, undaunted, gripping the rail
with grasp of iron, the captain stood on the
bridge, master of wave and wind.</p>

<p>Never had Roy welcomed daylight as he welcomed
the dawn next morning. All night long he
had sat at his instrument, waiting, waiting, waiting
for the moment when he might be needed. A
hundred times he had pictured the sea to himself;
but his wildest picture was tame in comparison
with the actual scene as revealed by the light of
dawn. The confusion of the waters was beyond
conception. Mountain high the seas were piling
up. Under the awful blasts of wind they rushed
forward like frenzied demons, frothing, seething,
hissing, roaring, climbing up and up until the
hurricane tore their tops away, flinging the spray
like tropic rain in blinding sheets. Again and
again Roy watched with bated breath as a monster
wave bore down on the ship, rising higher
and higher, until it plunged forward on the <em>Lycoming</em>
with a crash, shaking the sturdy ship from
stem to stern. The roar of the elements was
deafening. Beyond all power of imagination,
the tempest was awful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Hour by hour the stanch vessel fought her way
through the maelstrom. The wind tended ever
to blow her toward the keys and shoals that
menaced on the north, but the man on the bridge
kept pointing her into the wind. No land was
visible. Neither was the sun. It was impossible
to take a reckoning and determine the ship’s
position. Yet with that instinct born of years of
experience, the captain allowed for the drift,
gauged the ship’s speed, and kept her on her
course. Noon should normally have seen her far
past the Dry Tortugas. It was hours later when
the <em>Lycoming</em> actually reached them. For a few
minutes the rain ceased and the air cleared.
Again and again the man on the bridge swept the
horizon with his glasses. Finally he glimpsed
land. That one glance told him all he wanted to
know. He had seen a landmark on the Dry
Tortugas. He knew he was only slightly off
his course. At once he rectified his position.
The wide Gulf was now before him and, barring
accident, he knew he should come through safely.
But he was traveling with the hurricane. He did
not run through it, but advanced with it. So the
storm continued hour after hour without abatement.</p>

<p>Late in the day, Roy sought food. If he had
thought the storm terrible, within the shelter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the wireless house, he had no words to describe
it now as he stood in the open, exposed to the
elements. Clutching the rail with all his strength,
bending low before the gale, Roy advanced foot
by foot. He was almost afraid to go down the
ladder lest he be pitched headlong into the hissing
seas. A step at a time he descended, hugging
the ladder tenaciously. Then, crouching close to
the superstructure of the ship, he fought his way
against an awful wind until he reached a door.
In another second he was inside, trembling all
over from the violence of his efforts and his close
contact with the storm. When he remembered
that for twenty hours the captain had stood on
the bridge, facing that awful wind and those
crashing seas, he was speechless with admiration.
It was more than admiration. It was almost
worship. A burning desire came into his heart
to do something in return for the captain.</p>

<p>Roy got some food and the steward provided
him with a little bag of provisions so that he need
not leave the wireless house again until the storm
was over. Then Roy crept back up the ladder
and flung himself on his bed.</p>

<p>He slept for hours. During that time the ship
staggered on. All day and all night the hurricane
raged, and all the next day and the next
night. For forty-eight hours Captain Lansford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
never left the bridge. Then, utterly exhausted,
he staggered to his cabin and dropped asleep,
while Mr. Young took command. For twenty-four
hours the captain lay like one dead. Then
he returned to the bridge and again took command.
During all that time the storm continued
without abatement. The seas climbed higher
every hour under the terrific lashing of the
tempest.</p>

<p>Roy spent long hours at his post. Indeed, he
hardly laid aside his receivers except when he
snatched a little sleep. He got into touch with
the <em>Comal</em> again and learned that she had been
beached by the wind, but that no one was hurt.
The British oil tanker <em>Tonawanda</em> had been
scuttled to save the <em>Comal</em>. The steamer <em>Grampus</em>
and the schooner <em>E. V. Drew</em> had gone down
in the harbor, while Key West itself was prostrated.
Three hundred and twenty houses, together
with stores, churches, and other buildings
had been demolished. The wind had reached
a velocity of 110 miles an hour. From other
stations Roy learned of other damage. The
town of Gould was virtually razed. The wireless
station at Fort Taylor was wrecked. Towns
all along the eastern Gulf shore were badly damaged
by the awful wind. When Roy learned that
the <em>Valbanera</em> had gone down with all on board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
his face was very sober indeed. But for Captain
Lansford, thought Roy, the <em>Lycoming</em>, too,
might now be somewhere on the bottom of the
Gulf.</p>

<p>Another day passed. The hurricane blew with
undiminished force. With every hour of wind
the seas grew higher. But the <em>Lycoming</em>
weathered both wind and wave. She was drawing
near her destination. Her harbor was not
many hours distant. But could she make it?
Would she dare try to run between those walls
of stone in such a sea? Would she not have to
put back into the open Gulf, like the <em>Valbanera</em>,
and try to ride out the storm? These and a hundred
other questions Roy asked himself when he
realized that the <em>Lycoming</em> was drawing near
to Galveston. Then he thought of the sea-wall
and felt thankful it was there. If the <em>Lycoming</em>
had withstood the tempest, he felt sure the sea-wall
had, too. He shuddered to think what
would have happened had there been no sea-wall.</p>

<p>All the time Roy was working with his instruments,
trying to pick up news, listening for
voices in the air. Again and again he had tried
to get into touch with Galveston, but in vain.
It was not until the middle of the afternoon that
he finally reached the Marconi man there. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
was late Saturday afternoon. The Galveston
operator said the storm was then at its worst.
The sea was beating furiously at the sea-wall.
The wind was blowing nearly seventy miles an
hour. The barometer was way below thirty.
But the city was safe. He did not believe it
would be wise to attempt to enter the harbor with
such a sea running.</p>

<p>“Another night of it,” groaned Roy to himself,
as the Galveston man flashed good-bye. “I
hope I never see another storm like this. I’ll
have to give this news to the captain.”</p>

<p>Roy laid aside his receivers and picked up his
telephone. His signal was answered by the captain.</p>

<p>“Galveston man says storm at its height there
now,” telephoned Roy. “Does not think it safe
to try to enter harbor. Seventy-mile wind blowing.”</p>

<p>There was no reply. The captain had turned
away from the telephone in anger. He was the
judge of whether to enter the harbor or not, and
not some landlubber sitting where he couldn’t
even see the water.</p>

<p>Roy adjusted his receivers again. Hardly
were they in place before a sound crackled in his
ears, “SOS&mdash;SOS&mdash;SOS.”</p>

<p>It galvanized Roy into action. The blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
surged through his heart. With eager, trembling
fingers he flung back a reply.</p>

<p>“Who are you? I have your signal of distress.”</p>

<p>For what seemed an age he waited for an answer.
Outside, the wind was howling like a pack
of demons. The wireless house shook and trembled
under its awful blasts. The ship plunged
from side to side. Roy clung to his table as he
sat, tense and rigid, waiting for a reply.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he flashed again. “I have
your signal of distress.”</p>

<p>Again he waited. Would the wireless play
him false at such a critical minute? Were the
atmospherics to trick him again?</p>

<p>Then it came. “Steamer <em>Empress</em>, Rudder
broken. Drifting helpless.”</p>

<p>“Where are you?” flashed back Roy. “What
is your latitude and longitude?”</p>

<p>Crash! Bang! A terrible sea swept over the
<em>Lycoming</em>. She heeled far over. Something
had given way. Something was wrong with his
wireless. Trembling, Roy ran to his door and
peered out. His aerial was gone. It might take
hours perhaps to rig a new one, even if he could
get it up in the gale. What should he do? He
<em>must</em> get the <em>Empress’</em> reply. Roy leaped to the
deck. The broken lead-in wire was whipping in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the wind. Quick as thought, he snatched it up
and ran back into the wireless house with it. He
scraped the insulation from the broken end and
dived under his couch. In a second he had attached
the end of the wire to the couch spring.
In another he was back at his table, receivers
clamped to his head. Tense, breathless, rigid,
he listened. Would it work? Could he hear?</p>

<p>Then it came. “Latitude 28. Longitude 96.”</p>

<p>That was all he needed. Throwing his receivers
aside, Roy picked up his telephone.
Again he signaled the bridge. There was no
response. He signaled sharply. No answer
came. Again and again Roy tried to get the
captain. The telephone was silent. Either it
had been broken or the captain had been washed
away by the awful sea that had struck the ship.
In either case there was nothing to do but take
the message to the bridge himself. Roy leaped
to his feet and ran out of the wireless house,
utterly forgetful of wind and wave. Slipping,
scrambling, clutching rails and stanchions, Roy
fought his way forward. There was but one
thought in his mind&mdash;to get the news to the captain.
The latter was still at his post, though the
bridge rail was partly gone and the wheel-house
was stove in. The telephone apparatus was
smashed beyond recognition. Putting his mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to the captain’s ear, Roy shouted, “Steamer
<em>Empress</em> drifting with broken rudder. Latitude
28; longitude 96.”</p>

<p>The captain looked at him incredulously.</p>

<p>“She left Havana before her usual time,”
shouted Roy. “New schedule.”</p>

<p>For a single instant Captain Lansford bent
his piercing eyes on Roy. “Stand by to send a
message,” he roared. Then he sprang for the
chart house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">LATITUDE 28&mdash;LONGITUDE 96</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Roy rushed after him. “My aerial has
carried away, sir,” he shouted. “I cannot
send a message until it is repaired.”</p>

<p>“Fix it,” bellowed the captain, turning to his
charts.</p>

<p>Roy fought his way back to the wireless house,
pausing on the way to appraise the damage. The
aerial was entirely gone, spreaders and all. Fortunately
the halyards that held them aloft were
intact. Roy hurried on to the wireless house.
His closet was full of repair material. He got
out two spreaders, a coil of wire, some insulators,
and other needed materials. With remarkable
celerity he attached his wires to the spreader,
united them to a new lead-in wire and spliced
them to what was left of the old wire. It was
almost dark by the time he finished his repairs.
When all was ready, he struggled out with his
new aerial, and bent it to the halyards. In a few
moments it was swinging aloft. Roy watched it
for a minute as the tempest tore at it, to see if it
would hold. Nothing gave way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain, meantime, had snatched up a
chart. “Latitude 28, longitude 96,” he repeated,
as he ran his finger over the chart. His ruddy
face whitened as he found the spot. “Only
thirty-five miles off a lee shore,” he muttered,
“and one hundred and thirty miles from here.
Can I get to him in time?”</p>

<p>He turned to the man at the wheel and laid a
new course for him. Then he sprang to a speaking-tube
and ordered the chief engineer to crowd
on every ounce of steam he could make. As the
steersman swung the <em>Lycoming</em> to her new course
she heeled far over. Then she righted and rode
more steadily than before. The tempest had
changed from northwest to west and the <em>Lycoming</em>
was racing along almost with it. Though
not directly astern, waves and wind were both
driving the <em>Lycoming</em> forward. Soon she was
tearing through the water at a rate she had
never known before. Her very speed steadied
her.</p>

<p>Roy, meantime, had rushed into the wireless
house to test his apparatus. It appeared to work
perfectly. Satisfied, he battled his way to the
bridge again and reported to the captain.</p>

<p>“The damage is repaired, sir.”</p>

<p>The captain showed him the positions on the
chart. “Tell Charley we’re coming,” he roared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
“Find out just where he is, how he got there,
and what he’s doing.”</p>

<p>Roy left the bridge and faced toward the wireless
house. Now he was heading almost straight
into the wind. It seemed to him the tempest was
worse than ever. He could not advance a step.
Desperately he clung to a stanchion. He dared
not try to walk across the few feet of deck to
the hand-rail on the superstructure lest he be
picked up bodily and flung into the sea. He
dropped to his knees, and fairly hugging the deck,
crept fearfully over to the rail. There he was
partly sheltered from the direct blasts. Crouching
low and pulling himself along with arms and
feet, he fought his way to the wireless house. It
did not seem possible that a wind <em>could</em> be so
terrible.</p>

<p>Roy adjusted his receivers, threw over his
switch, and sent the <em>Empress’</em> call signal flashing
forth. “KKK&mdash;KKK&mdash;KKK de WNA.”</p>

<p>Then he waited anxiously. Would he get a
reply, or would the atmospherics trick him again?
At one hundred and thirty miles’ distance he
ought to communicate with the <em>Empress</em> easily.
He was not long in suspense. Promptly a wireless
signal buzzed in his ears.</p>

<p>“WNA de KKK. Have been calling you
steadily.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“KKK de WNA,” flashed back Roy. “My
aerial carried away. Got your position all right.
Tell your captain the <em>Lycoming</em> is rushing to
help you. We are a few hours east of Galveston
and one hundred and thirty miles from the position
you signaled. We must be making twenty
knots an hour. Should reach you in five to six
hours. Keep us informed of your position. Are
you all right? How did you get there? What
are you doing?”</p>

<p>“WNA de KKK,” came back the reply.
“<em>Empress</em> reached Galveston early this morning.
Sea too rough to enter port. Headed into
Gulf to ride out storm. Broke rudder six hours
ago. Drifted four hours, then put down anchors,
but dragging fast. Captain couldn’t get observation.
Position given obtained by dead-reckoning.
Trying to repair damage. Sea too
high to do much. Ship all right so far. No
land in sight. Change in wind helpful. Blowing
us toward shore at long angle. Captain
reckons six to eight hours before we ground.
Reckons we are dragging straight toward Corpus
Christi.”</p>

<p>“KKK de WNA,” signaled back Roy. “Will
report to captain. Will call you every quarter
hour. Good luck.”</p>

<p>Once more Roy made the perilous trip to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
bridge. “Come inside,” shouted the captain,
dragging Roy within the wheel-house. Roy delivered
his message and the captain listened without
comment.</p>

<p>“Any message, Captain?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“No. Keep in close touch with them.”</p>

<p>“I have already arranged to call them every
quarter hour.”</p>

<p>“Good. Go back to your post.”</p>

<p>“How shall I know if you want me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll send a messenger.”</p>

<p>Roy hurried from the wheel-house and vanished
in the dark. Hour after hour the <em>Lycoming</em>
raced toward the <em>Empress</em>. The seas were as
mountainous and the winds as fierce as any the
<em>Lycoming</em> had encountered, but the ship was
running with them and its passage was less rough
than it had been at any time since the tempest
struck her. Unable to see the waves any longer,
Roy almost believed that the storm was subsiding.
Every quarter hour Roy called the <em>Empress</em>.
At each call he got back the same reply.
The <em>Empress</em> was battered but still safe. She
was dragging her anchors. Every time Roy
talked to her, the signals seemed more distinct.
There could be no question that the <em>Lycoming</em>
was getting nearer.</p>

<p>Four hours passed. A terrified darky cabin-boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
crept into the wireless house. “De cap’n
say tell de <em>Empress</em> to show her search-light,” he
said.</p>

<p>Roy signaled the <em>Empress</em>, “Show your search-light.”</p>

<p>Back came the answer, “Search-light out of
commission.”</p>

<p>“Tell the captain the <em>Empress’</em> search-light is
broken,” said Roy to the young darky.</p>

<p>“Does I haf to go back to de cap’n, Mr. Mercer?”
cried the colored boy, shaking with fright.</p>

<p>“No,” said Roy, jumping to his feet. “Stay
here,” and he disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em to burn lights and send up rockets
every few minutes,” ordered the captain, when
Roy had delivered his message.</p>

<p>Roy regained the wireless house and signaled
the <em>Empress</em>.</p>

<p>“We’ve been doing that for hours,” came back
the reply. “Supply almost exhausted.”</p>

<p>Again Roy had to fight his way to the bridge
with the message. It might be important for the
captain to know about the lights.</p>

<p>Another hour passed. The <em>Empress</em> was not
within sight. For half an hour longer the captain
held to his course. Then he headed the
<em>Lycoming</em> nearer shore. Another half hour
passed. The <em>Empress</em> was still invisible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Then an able-bodied seaman appeared in the
wireless house and said, “The captain says to
see if you can find out anything about the location
of the <em>Empress</em>, sir.”</p>

<p>Into Roy’s mind flashed the remembrance of
the fog off Hatteras. He had located the <em>Merrimack</em>
in the fog. The captain must believe he
could also find the <em>Empress</em> by wireless. It was
a great opportunity.</p>

<p>“Tell him I’ll try,” said Roy.</p>

<p>The seaman started for the bridge. Roy
dropped his head in his hands and began to think.
How could he locate the <em>Empress</em>? A direction
finder such as they had in the search for the secret
wireless would do the trick at once. But he had
no direction finder. Then Roy remembered how
the wireless patrol had improvised a direction
finder during the hunt for the dynamiters at
Camp Brady. He had helped make that instrument.
He could make another. Before he began,
he decided to call up the <em>Empress</em> again. Hardly
had he adjusted his receivers before a signal
crackled in his ears.</p>

<p>“WNA de KKK. Can see a search-light.
Is it yours?”</p>

<p>“Will have the light swung in an arc three
times. Watch,” flashed back Roy.</p>

<p>The seaman had not returned, and again Roy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
had to go to the bridge. “Swing the search-light
overhead in an arc three times,” shouted Roy.
“The <em>Empress</em> thinks she sees us.” Then Roy
added, “Please send a seaman to carry messages
for me.”</p>

<p>The great beam of light that had been boring
into the darkness ahead swung round to starboard,
then slowly traveled in an arc directly over
the <em>Lycoming</em> until it came to rest on the seething
waters to port. Then it retraced its path. A
third time it circled overhead, lighting up the
heavy canopy of clouds. Meantime Roy had regained
the wireless house. Trembling with
eagerness, he clamped his receivers to his ears and
listened.</p>

<p>“WNA de KKK,” presently came a signal.
“It’s your light. We saw it swing overhead
three times. Can see its beams now.”</p>

<p>“Get a compass bearing on it and signal me,”
flashed Roy.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the answer came. “Almost
due east.”</p>

<p>Roy sent the news to the captain. “She’s
dragged more than I thought possible,” muttered
the captain as he entered the chart house. Then,
turning to the steersman, he ordered, “Starboard&mdash;head
her due west.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later lights flashed out directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
ahead of the <em>Lycoming</em>, then disappeared
again. It was the <em>Empress</em> as she rose and fell
with the waves. She was only a few miles distant.
A few minutes later the <em>Lycoming</em> was
close to her.</p>

<p>To Roy, watching from the wireless house, it
did not seem humanly possible that the <em>Lycoming</em>
could assist the <em>Empress</em>. The latter lay with
her nose to the storm, rising and falling with the
waves and rolling violently. Roy could see two
great anchor chains leading down into the water.
Most of the time the <em>Empress</em> rode the huge
swells buoyantly. But occasionally the crest of
a great wave broke over her and went rushing aft
with an awful roar, smashing woodwork and
twisting iron. As the <em>Lycoming’s</em> search-light
played on the <em>Empress</em> Roy could see that her
bulwarks and rails were smashed to pieces. All
but one of her small boats had carried away.
Her life-rafts were gone. Part of the railing
about the bridge was smashed. To Roy she
seemed all but battered to pieces. To an experienced
sailor like Captain Lansford, she appeared
to be in good shape. The ship herself was intact.</p>

<p>How any earthly power could get lines aboard
of her, or how it could tow her in the teeth of such
a gale, even if the lines were got aboard, was more
than Roy could understand. He did not believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
it possible. He did not believe any small boat
could exist for one minute in that raging sea.
Yet he knew very well that Captain Lansford intended
to assist the <em>Empress</em>. What he would
do Roy could not conceive. All he could do was
to watch and learn.</p>

<p>For some time Roy could not see that anything
was being done. The <em>Lycoming</em> reduced her
speed, but kept steadily on past the <em>Empress</em>.
Then she began to swing around her in a wide
arc. Roy believed the captain meant to approach
close to the ship from the leeward side.
But when the <em>Lycoming</em> continued to circle
slowly around the <em>Empress</em>, Roy was puzzled.</p>

<p>The <em>Lycoming</em> swung completely round the
<em>Empress</em>, but not until the circuit had been completed
did Roy get an inkling of what the captain
was doing. The search-light played here and
there, now picking out the path of the <em>Lycoming</em>,
now illuminating the <em>Empress</em>, which tossed
violently at the very centre of the huge circle the
<em>Lycoming</em> had just traced. To his intense surprise
Roy saw that the water within this circle
was calming down. It rose and fell as mightily
as ever, but no seas broke. Giant waves mounted
higher and higher, gathering volume and power
as they rushed down on the <em>Empress</em>, but instead
of breaking with a crash and hurling tons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
water at the helpless steamer, they subsided without
foam or fuss. It was as though some invisible
hand had spread a great, elastic blanket over
the face of the seething waters. They billowed
and tossed beneath this invisible blanket, but they
billowed and tossed harmlessly. The power of
the waves to smash things was gone. Amazed,
incredulous, disbelieving the very thing his eyes
beheld, Roy watched the miracle that was being
performed. Finally it came to him that Captain
Lansford was putting oil on the sea.</p>

<p>In the nose of the <em>Lycoming</em> sailors had been at
work for hours preparing to perform the miracle
that Roy was watching. Great, cone-shaped
bags had been made of canvas and stuffed with
oakum. The oakum had been saturated with
storm oil. The bags had been suspended over
the forward wash-basins so that at the proper
time their contents could drain into the sea. Additional
supplies of oil stood at hand in cans.
Long before the <em>Lycoming</em> came abreast of the
<em>Empress</em>, Captain Lansford had everything in
readiness to spread abroad the oil film that was
now taming the seas before Roy’s astonished
vision. At the proper moment word was passed
to start the oil. With coarse sailmakers’ needles
the canvas cones were punctured and the oil began
to flow. Drip, drip, drip, drip, it fell into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the wash-basins and made its way down the drain-pipes
to the sea, hushing the boisterous breakers
even as Christ stilled the waters with His command,
“Peace. Be still.”</p>

<p>Three times the <em>Lycoming</em> circled the <em>Empress</em>,
each time at a greater distance, until the waters
for a mile about the crippled liner were coated
with oil. Then Captain Lansford brought the
<em>Lycoming</em> as close as he dared to the <em>Empress</em>,
which lay directly to leeward. A great life-boat
was unlashed and made ready for launching. Up
to this time Roy had remained in the wireless
house. Now he made his way to the deck, where
some sailors were gathered beside the life-boat.
The captain stood on the bridge with a megaphone
in his hand. He roared out a call for volunteers
to man the boat. There was a rush for
the smaller craft. Without pausing to consider,
Roy leaped into the boat. He found himself
seated beside the sailor who had come to the wireless
house with the captain’s message. The boat
was manned almost before Roy was fairly seated.
The third officer sat in the stern to steer her.</p>

<p>The captain was scanning the sea critically.
“Launch her!” he bellowed suddenly.</p>

<p>The boat swung outboard and dropped on the
smooth crest of a wave. The tackles were cast
loose and all hands gave way with the oars that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
their tiny craft might not be smashed against the
<em>Lycoming’s</em> side. Before the next wave rose
they were at a safe distance from the <em>Lycoming</em>.
The lines they were to take to the <em>Empress</em> trailed
astern.</p>

<p>From the deck of the <em>Lycoming</em> the oily sea
had seemed comparatively peaceful. Once Roy
was on it in a small boat, he found it was terrible.
The little life-boat was tossed about like a cork
in a boiling caldron. Now it shot high in the air,
lifted by some mighty roller. Now it dropped
down, down, down, until Roy thought it would
surely go to the bottom. Once away from the
protection of the <em>Lycoming</em>, the life-boat felt the
full force of the wind. It seemed to Roy the
blasts would jerk him from his seat and throw
him into the maelstrom. Now the boat bobbed
this way. Now she ducked the other way. A
feather whirling in the tempest could hardly have
been more unstable.</p>

<p>In such a sea none but an expert oarsman could
wield a great oar such as Roy now grasped.
Had he been the least bit awkward with it, he
might easily have caused disaster. Roy realized
that at once and thanked his lucky stars that he
had learned to row well that first summer in camp
at Fort Brady. Now he gave way smoothly and
with power. Through the darkness he tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
see the stroke oar and pull in unison. The
search-light pointed its powerful ray over their
heads, lighting the way for the steersman. It
was useless to call the strokes of the oars. In the
shrieking wind no earthly voice could have been
heard. There was nothing to do but sit tight and
pull.</p>

<p>Slowly the boat forged through the seething
sea. It neared the <em>Empress</em>, which seemed to
bulk as huge as a mountain. Painfully the little
craft fought her way to the leeward side of the
<em>Empress</em> and crept as near as she dared. Lines
were flung from the <em>Empress</em>. They were bent
to those the life-boat was towing. Slowly these
were hauled to the ship, and the crew began to
pull on the heavy hawsers to which the life-boat
lines were attached. The <em>Lycoming’s</em> boat
worked its way along the lee side of the <em>Empress</em>,
toward the davits that had been swung outboard
to lift it. Suddenly there was a great outcry
aboard the <em>Empress</em>. The anchor chains had
snapped. At once all hands were called forward
to pull on the hawsers. Unless they were got
aboard the <em>Empress</em> was doomed.</p>

<p>Straightway the wind drove her directly toward
the little life-boat. With all their might
the men in the boat pulled away from the ship,
which would have crushed them like an egg-shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moment they had passed from under her
protecting side and found themselves pitching
wildly on the inky waves. To get back to the
<em>Lycoming</em> was impossible. To try to gain the
<em>Empress</em> was worse than useless. To stay where
they were was folly. The only hope of safety
lay in scudding before the storm. Instantly the
third officer’s decision was taken.</p>

<p>“Give way,” he roared, and as the crew bent to
their oars, he swept the tiny boat around. In
another moment the little craft was racing before
the tempest, tossing wildly, but thanks to the oil
film, riding buoyantly and safely. Rapidly the
<em>Empress</em> and the <em>Lycoming</em> fell astern. Soon
they were lost to sight. Above the life-boat the
night was inky black. About her the waters
heaved and roared. Ahead of her lay the wild
sea, with its awful waves and its fearful, crashing
combers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">LAND AHEAD!</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">On rushed the little craft. Aboard the <em>Lycoming</em>
the seas had seemed terrible. To
Roy, in an open boat, they were stupefying in
their awfulness. No power of imagination could
conjure up anything so terrific as this hellish
welter of water. It hissed and seethed and
roared and tumbled. It boiled up in fury. It
was paralyzing in its awfulness. It benumbed
mind and body. Terrified, aghast, Roy huddled
down in his seat. Then he thought of the captain.
His courage came back. The blood again
coursed through his veins. He gripped his oar
and bent to his task with a will. He did not believe
he would ever reach the shore. But if he
were to die, he meant to die like a man. He
thought of the wireless operator on the <em>Comal</em>
who had bidden him good luck even as he was
drifting to what seemed certain death. Roy took
a last look at the <em>Empress</em>. “Good luck!” he
shouted, then bent to his oar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>The wind snatched the words out of his mouth.
The man beside him did not know he had spoken.
The clamor of the elements drowned all other
sounds. Conversation was impossible. The
mate at the stern could not make his orders heard.
There was nothing to do but sit tight and row.
That helped to steady the boat.</p>

<p>On they went. Now they were down in the
trough of a wave. Now they were on a mountainous
crest. Thanks to the oil slick, no water
came aboard. But the edge of the oil film was
near at hand. Straight ahead of them Roy knew
the waves were breaking with awful violence.
Soon they would be among those unbridled crests.
Let but one of them come toppling down upon
the little boat and all would be over. Roy gritted
his teeth at the thought. “At any rate I’ll die
game,” he muttered.</p>

<p>The life-boat mounted upward. Up and up it
climbed on the slope of a huge comber. It
reached the top.</p>

<p>“Lights ahead!” cried the mate, who was facing
forward. “Lights ahead!”</p>

<p>A single oarsman caught the words. From
man to man it was shouted the length of the boat.
“Lights ahead!” The life-boat topped the wave
and plunged forward into the trough. Again it
climbed upward. The mate strained his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
through the blackness. This time he saw many
lights stretching for a long distance.</p>

<p>“Land ahead!” he roared. Again the cry
was carried forward from man to man, “Land
ahead!”</p>

<p>Hope sprang up in Roy’s heart. If they could
see lights from a little boat, the lights must be
near at hand. Poor Roy! He did not know the
lights were high on a bluff and could be seen for
miles. “We’re going to make it!” he cried to
himself, and fresh courage came to him.</p>

<p>The little boat shot past the protecting oil slick.
Roy knew it in a second, even though he could see
nothing in the darkness. At once the waters became
frenzied. The little craft no longer
smoothly rode the swells. She was tossed like a
chip in a whirlpool. The waters boiled up under
her, seethed around her, and came together with
terrific impact. The waves broke with a surging
roar past description. To make matters worse,
the wind shifted, coming directly off shore. Roy
noted the fact with joy. It might mean the salvation
of the <em>Empress</em>. Spray filled the air. It
flew in blinding, drenching torrents before the
blast. It soaked the oarsmen. It began to fill
their boat. The awful wind chilled the rowers to
the bone. Yet all the time they advanced. Despite
the wind, the waves and the power of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
own efforts flung them shoreward at an incredible
pace. The lights were coming nearer.</p>

<p>Dawn was approaching, too. Low on the
horizon the rowers saw the first faint streaks of
light. Their courage increased. They bent to
their oars with renewed strength. As the light
grew, the man at the helm began to pick out objects
ahead of him. The distant land was faintly
silhouetted against the pale morning sky. Intently
he watched, looking for familiar landmarks.
Suddenly he knew where he was. The
little boat was driving straight for Corpus
Christi.</p>

<p>He began to hope that they might reach shore
in safety. He knew the harbor well. Mustang
Island was dead ahead. Aransas Pass was only
slightly to starboard. If he could work the boat
over sufficiently, they might shoot through the
pass into Corpus Christi Bay and safety. Could
he do it?</p>

<p>He leaned against his steering oar and skilfully
pointed the life-boat’s nose a bit to starboard.
The wind was no longer dead ahead and the craft
was no longer running directly with the waves.
She was quartering, cutting through them at an
angle. This was dangerous, but necessary to
ultimate safety. If she could advance a few
hundred yards to starboard the channel would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
dead ahead and she could run to safety straight
before the waves.</p>

<p>She had almost gained her distance when a
monster wave broke just behind her. A thousand
tons of water came crashing down on the
rowers. Boat and oarsmen disappeared from
sight, and the wave rushed on shoreward.</p>

<p>Down, down, down into the seething vortex
went the crew. Roy thought he would never
come to the surface. He tried to fight his way
upward but the swirling water sucked him down.
He felt as though his lungs would burst. Just
when he thought he could hold his breath no
longer, his head popped above the water. He
gasped for air, then looked about him for his companions.</p>

<p>The boat, overturned, floated near by. Oars
were bobbing here and there on the waves. One
by one his companions came up. Roy counted
heads. All were there but the mate. Something
bumped Roy violently from behind. He turned
around. The mate, unconscious, had just come
to the surface. His own oar had knocked him
senseless as the boat capsized.</p>

<p>Roy grabbed the mate by the hair and called
for help. Nobody heard him. Everybody was
swimming for the overturned boat. A long oar
was floating near Roy. He grabbed it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
shoving it ahead of him, fought his way to a
second oar, towing the mate behind him. The
struggle, though brief, was so violent that it almost
exhausted him. He got an oar under each
of the mate’s arms. Then slowly treading water
and holding fast to the two oars himself, he tried
to recover his strength.</p>

<p>Presently the mate regained consciousness.
He grabbed the oars convulsively. He did not
know that Roy was behind him until he tried to
swim and his feet struck him. The mate looked
around and saw Roy. He comprehended the
situation at a glance. Roy had saved his life.
He also saw that their best chance lay in getting
to the overturned craft.</p>

<p>“To the boat!” he shouted, taking one oar and
leaving the other for Roy. Then he struck off
toward the life-boat. The two fought their way
back to their comrades, all of whom had reached
the boat.</p>

<p>They were trying to right it, but the task
proved impossible. Evidently there was considerable
air under the boat, for her bottom was high
out of water and she was riding the waves buoyantly.
One by one they crawled up on the boat
and lay flat on their bellies, clinging desperately
to the heaving craft. Again and again men slid
back into the sea. Their comrades pulled them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
up again. Once every soul was washed overboard
by a breaking wave but all got back.</p>

<p>The cold wind chilled them to the bone, benumbing
them. In comparison, the sea felt
warm. Finally Roy was so cold he could endure
it no longer. He slid from the boat’s bottom and
gripping her keel, clung just astern. Only his
head and arms were above water. Gradually he
grew warmer.</p>

<p>Dawn changed to the full light of day. As
every wave lifted them up, the shipwrecked
mariners could plainly see the land before them.
They could even make out the terrific surges as
the waves broke on the shores of Mustang and
Rockport Islands. They knew, unless the end
came sooner, that there was where the pinch
would come&mdash;when they had reached the long,
sloping beach and were being pounded by the
terrific surf. For the sea was bearing them
slowly toward land.</p>

<p>An hour passed. They were appreciably
nearer land though still far from shore. Another
hour went by. Now they were near enough to
shore to distinguish small objects on land. The
breakers were not far distant. It was close to
eight o’clock, though no one in the group knew
what the hour was, when the sea began suddenly
to move shoreward in a mysterious, irresistible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
fashion. As though power had been applied to
it, the overturned boat started toward the land.
Roy tried to scramble up on it. A small wave,
traveling shoreward with terrific velocity, banged
Roy against the craft, then tore him loose from it,
swept over the boat, and sped shoreward. The
men clung to the boat frantically. Not one was
washed off. The mate was still grasping an oar.
He flung it to Roy, who grabbed it and tried to
swim back to the life-boat. The current swept
him away, but both Roy and his comrades were
borne rapidly and irresistibly forward, as wave
after wave, each higher than its predecessor,
rolled in from the sea, carrying everything before
them.</p>

<p>Through the blinding spray and the heaving
waters, Roy tried to see where he was going.
He could feel himself being carried forward at
great speed. He knew he must soon come to
land. But the thought of the breakers sickened
him. The current had drifted him opposite Mustang
Island again. Straight in he drove, but the
pounding breakers seemed to diminish as Roy
drew near them. Then they disappeared altogether.
In another minute Roy was floating
over what, a short time before, had been Mustang
Island. For the first time he realized that he
was in the grasp of a tidal wave. Instantly he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
thought of Galveston and wondered if Corpus
Christi was to suffer as its sister city had done.</p>

<p>But he had small opportunity to think about
anything save his own safety. Before Roy knew
it he was in the midst of a struggling herd of
cattle. Even above the roar of the storm he
could hear their frenzied bellowing as the sea
swept over their grazing-grounds and carried
them into Corpus Christi Bay. More dangerous
than the sea was the furious struggling of these
frantic animals. With all his might Roy strove
to get clear of them. Avoiding striking hoof and
plunging horn, he swam to one side of the herd,
and the current soon swept him clear of them.</p>

<p>But in his flight he lost his oar. He had now
only his own exertions to sustain himself. And
his violent efforts to get free of the cattle had
tired him utterly. He must find something to
help float him and find it soon. He began to
look about him. The bay was full of wreckage.
A dark object rolling in the waves at a distance
attracted Roy. It looked like an overturned
boat. Roy swam for it. As he approached, a
wave partly righted it. Roy saw before him a
good-sized launch. It lifted still farther out of
water and he caught the name <em>Waldo</em>. Then the
craft rolled back until only one side was visible
above the flood. But that was enough to sustain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Roy, and with a thankful heart he crawled up on
the stricken launch and lay down on it at full
length.</p>

<p>The current bore him on and on and great
waves continued to roll in from the sea. The
wind was blowing as violently as any wind Roy
had encountered in all the days of storm through
which he had passed. But within the landlocked
bay the waves were pigmies compared to
the giant rollers in the Gulf. Furthermore, the
inrushing tidal wave seemed to beat down and
flatten all opposing waves. Roy felt sure that
he would now reach the shore in safety.</p>

<p>Presently his strength came back to him. He
sat up and looked about him. Already the inrushing
tide had carried him far up the bay. He
judged that this might be eight or ten miles wide.
How long it was he could not guess, though he
was certain that its length must be at least double
its width. Far to the west he could dimly see
there was a city. There were high bluffs there
and he felt sure that he saw buildings. But the
blinding spray made his vision uncertain.</p>

<p>Wreckage floated on all sides of him. Telephone-poles,
uprooted trees, fence-posts, logs,
planks, roofs, doorsteps, porches, parts of buildings,
and a thousand other floating objects filled
the bay. The farther Roy traveled, the more numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
became these floating objects. Soon Roy
began to fear that he might be pounded to death
by the wreckage. It began to collect about his
boat and to beat against it. Suddenly a great
log was catapulted, end on, straight at the
<em>Waldo</em>. With a crash that was audible above
the storm it stove in one entire side of the launch
and the <em>Waldo</em> disappeared amid the swirling
wreckage. But Roy had foreseen what would
happen. Scrambling to his feet, he leaped far to
one side as the boat sank, and swimming under
water came up clear of the wreckage. A large
tree was floating near by, riding majestically
through the waves. Roy swam to it, and, grasping
some roots, pulled himself up on the trunk.
To his horror he found a rattlesnake coiled up on
the tree. For a moment Roy was on the point of
jumping back into the water. But the reptile
showed no disposition to molest him, and Roy
stuck to the log. He kept one eye on the snake
and watched closely for a new support.</p>

<p>The current drove him on and on, though all
the while it shunted him toward the south shore.
Now he could plainly see the city. It was apparent
the waves were carrying him straight for it.
As he drew near he saw that the water had already
spread far up in the town. Waves were
surging about all the houses in the lower part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the city. From these houses persons were wading
toward the higher ground far inland. It was
an awful sight. Block after block of dwellings
stood in the flood, and Roy could see that every
minute the waters were rising higher. Everywhere
little groups of refugees were struggling
through the swirling waves, slipping, stumbling,
clinging desperately to one another as they raced
with death through the rising waters. With incredible
swiftness the flood deepened around the
doomed dwellings.</p>

<p>People appeared at second-story windows.
Terrified men, women, and children who had lingered
too long, leaned from these windows with
blanched faces, looking for means of rescue. The
floating wreckage, now blown together in solid
masses, drove into the city and began to batter
the inundated dwellings. Roy shuddered. He
knew what it meant.</p>

<p>Even as he looked a dwelling collapsed, spreading
apart like a house of cards and falling into the
flood. “Great God!” cried Roy, shuddering
with horror. There had been faces at the second-story
window. Another house went down. A
third split in half, like a beef riven along the
chine, and the two halves leaned away from each
other and toppled over into the flood. By the
height of the water on the buildings Roy judged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
that the waves must be ten feet deep. House
after house went down. As each collapsed, the
wreckage added volume to the mass of floating
débris that was battering the city to pieces. Now
dwellings went down by tens, now by scores.
They disappeared faster than Roy could count.
The noise of the tempest and the battering of
house against house was indescribable.</p>

<p>Everywhere men, women, and children were
leaping from their homes into the flood. Some
disappeared forever. Some were able to crawl
up on floating timbers. Some were crushed beyond
recognition. As the houses fell apart, the
terrible wind picked up boards and planks and
hurled them hither and thither. The air was
filled with flying timbers. A great board came
sailing directly toward Roy. It would have
killed him had it touched him. He fell flat on
the tree trunk and the board whizzed over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>But the movement brought Roy within a few
inches of the snake. Terrified, he leaped to his
feet again and began to look for another refuge.
The side of a house floated by. It was within
twenty feet. Gathering himself for the effort,
Roy leaped on a large timber, then to a telegraph-pole,
and from that to the side of the house.
He reached it safely. It was still firm and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
rode high out of water. Evidently there were
big timbers beneath it, buoying it up. Roy
found that he could walk around on it safely.</p>

<p>The sight of so many persons distressed and
dying was sickening. Roy’s heart cried out to
rescue them but he was helpless. His raft was
wedged in a mass of débris acres in extent, that
grew as every collapsing house was added to it,
that became every moment more compact, and
that was flung forward by the irresistible current,
mowing down houses as a scythe topples over
grain. He dared not try to cross the floating
mass. Inevitably he would have sunk through
it. Once beneath the mass death would have
been certain. All he could do was to stick to his
raft and wait for the moment for escape.</p>

<p>On and on drove the mass. Where a few
minutes previously houses had stood by hundreds,
there were now only acres and acres of tossing
débris. On every side Roy saw refugees, riding
like himself on the wreckage or clinging to floating
logs or planks.</p>

<p>Anxiously Roy peered through the spray and
rain, sheltering his eyes with his hands, and trying
to discover where he was going. Behind him
were the raging waters of the bay. Far to the
right, beyond the houses among which Roy’s raft
had drifted, Roy could see more open water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Ahead another stretch of writhing water appeared.
Roy judged that the dwellings around
him must be on a narrow point of land. If he
were washed across that point, a great, open
stretch of water would lie before him again.
Only to the left could he see dry ground. In
that direction were high bluffs. He bent all his
efforts toward gaining these heights.</p>

<p>His raft, heavier than most pieces of wreckage,
drove through the mass irresistibly under the
pressure of the waves. Roy saw that it would
surely batter its way across North Beach, and be
driven into the water of Nueces Bay, which he
had glimpsed beyond. If that happened he
would again be helplessly exposed to the fury of
the tempest. A long pole came driving by and
fell into the water beside Roy’s raft. Roy leaned
far over the edge and grasped it. He found that
he could touch bottom with it. He tried to work
his raft toward the high ground. It was so bulky
he could do nothing with it.</p>

<p>Two short telephone-poles, lashed together,
were floating near by. Roy leaped on them and
found that they would carry him safely. With
his pole he was able to shove them through the
water and thrust aside obstructing pieces of
wreckage. He worked his way clear of the mass
and got into what had been a street running toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the bluffs. Now it was like a canal in
Venice. The houses on either side stood deep in
water. None had yet collapsed and the great
mass of wreckage had largely been held back by
the rows of houses still standing on the seaward
side. Up this watery avenue Roy forced his
craft as best he could. The turbulent waves
tossed him about, the current continually bore
him against the houses, and the wreckage impeded
him. By the greatest exertion Roy overcame
all obstacles and drove his little raft nearer
and nearer his haven.</p>

<p>As he drew closer to the bluffs, the water became
shallower. Presently it was no more than
waist-deep. All about him people were dropping
from their homes into the flood. A woman
with a little child appeared at a window directly
above Roy’s raft and called for help.</p>

<p>“Drop her,” shouted Roy.</p>

<p>The woman lifted the child through the window
and dropped her. Roy caught the sobbing
child and placed her on the raft at his feet. The
woman crawled from the window and fell into
Roy’s arms. He was knocked down, but he
managed to hold the woman on the raft. She
picked up her child. Roy looked for his pole.
It had been washed away. He leaped into the
water, which was no more than waist-deep, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
tried to drag the raft toward shore. The waves
battered and beat him. The raft was tossed
about. But Roy clung to it and gradually
dragged it into shallower water. Finally he put
the baby on his shoulder, and leading the woman
by the hand, waded to safety.</p>

<p>All about them scores of wet and terrified persons
were similarly seeking safety. “Go to the
court-house,” he heard some one say. He inquired
the direction and made his way thither
with the woman and the child. The streets in the
business section were already under water. The
court-house was waist-deep, but they gained it in
safety. “Thank God!” exclaimed Roy.</p>

<p>In the building were scores and scores of terrified
refugees, huddling together in white-faced
fear. Nobody knew what might happen. For
a moment Roy did not know what to do. He
looked with a sick heart at the sad company about
him. He could do nothing to help them. Then
he thought of the white faces he had seen in the
doomed houses past which he had floated. He
knew what his duty was. He bent and kissed the
child he had rescued. “Good luck!” he said to
her, and turning away from this haven of safety,
went out again into the flood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">BACK INTO THE STORM</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The rising waters forced him again to seek
safety. He struggled through them and
reached dry land. He was almost exhausted.
He had had no food since supper time the night
before. For hours he had been exposed to wind
and water. He had almost reached the limit of
endurance. He staggered on, not knowing what
to do or where to go. A boy scout came hurrying
by.</p>

<p>“Where could I get a bite to eat?” asked Roy.
“I’m nearly dead.”</p>

<p>“Go to the Red Cross headquarters in the
First Presbyterian Church,” replied the scout,
and directed Roy how to find the church.</p>

<p>Roy staggered on. He was so nearly exhausted
that he could hardly make his way up to
the church. Other refugees, like himself, were
heading for the place. It was a sorry procession.
At length the church was reached. There was
food in abundance and coffee steaming hot. Roy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
ate as though famished. He drank cup after
cup of coffee. Never had he tasted anything so
good. The coffee warmed and stimulated him.
His strength returned to him as he rested and ate.
He watched the Red Cross women as they ministered
to other refugees. He admired the cool,
skilled way they did their work, the quiet manner
in which they cared for others when perhaps their
own homes were imperiled. The thought was
like a galvanic shock to Roy. This was no place
for him, this warm and comfortable church. He
had a duty to perform, too. His duty was out
there in the storm. And again he thought of
those white faces at the windows.</p>

<p>Back into the storm he plunged, seeking where
he might be most helpful. In no time he was at
the water’s edge again. Scores of persons were
still marooned in their houses. They must be
gotten out or they would be drowned. The
water was almost at its highest and the storm was
licking up dwelling after dwelling. Roy looked
about him. Four white faces were peering from
a near-by house. Roy waded toward it. The
water crept up around him but he gained the
building. The sea had broken open a door.
Roy entered, found the stairway, and went up to
the terrified inmates. They were a mother and
three little girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come quick,” he said, “or it will be too late.”</p>

<p>The children held back, afraid to step into the
water. “Get on my back,” said Roy, picking up
the largest child.</p>

<p>He went down the stairs and struggled to land.
The water was waist-deep and running like a
mill-race.</p>

<p>“Wait here until I bring the others,” said Roy
as he placed the child in a sheltered doorway.</p>

<p>Again he waded through the flood. The water
nearly swept him off his feet. He got another
child on his back.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said to the woman. “If you do
not leave at once you can never get ashore. I
will come back for the baby.”</p>

<p>The woman hesitated. “You are risking
everything,” said Roy. “We’ll all be drowned
if you do not come at once.”</p>

<p>The woman began to sob hysterically. She refused
to move. Roy was sadly perplexed.
Something <em>must</em> be done at once. But how?
Into Roy’s mind flashed the thought of his commander.
He knew what Captain Lansford
would do. He would compel obedience. Roy
ceased to argue with the woman.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” he shouted harshly. He
seized the woman by the shoulder and roughly
forced her down the stairs. Then he seized her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
hand. “Come on,” he said roughly and dragged
her into the flood.</p>

<p>Desperately he fought to get her to land. The
child on his back weighted him down. The current
swirled about him. He could hardly keep
his feet. He struggled on, dragging, pushing,
pulling the woman toward shore. A plank
washed near him. He grabbed it and shoved it
to his companion. The plank steadied her and
she made better progress. They gained the shallower
water and got beyond the reach of the
waves.</p>

<p>“Go to that doorway and wait for me,” said
Roy, pointing out the refuge of the child he had
already taken ashore. He handed the child on
his back to its mother. Then he turned back.
This time he had to swim. The waters had risen
so high he could no longer wade. He reached
the house and found the baby safe on the upper
floor. At first he did not know how to get her
ashore. She was too little to cling to his shoulders.
Something had to be done quick. He
snatched a sheet from the bed, folded it, and tied
the baby on his back. Then he went down into
the flood, and struggling desperately, got back to
land. He took the baby in his arms and leading
the others, made his way again up to the Red
Cross headquarters. When they got there, night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
was not far distant. The crest of the flood had
been reached. The wind still blew at hurricane
force. Roy delivered his charges to a Red Cross
nurse and was about to turn away, but the woman
he had rescued caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>“How can I ever thank you?” she cried. “If
you had not compelled me to go we should all
have drowned.”</p>

<p>Roy did not know what to say. He suddenly
felt embarrassed. “I’m glad you’re all safe,”
he muttered and turned away.</p>

<p>But he did not go back into the storm. Suddenly
a great weakness possessed him. His legs
refused to hold him up. He was quivering all
over. He believed he was about to be sick. He
sought out a warm corner and sat down. But he
was not sick. It was only outraged nature taking
her toll. Roy was utterly exhausted. The
coffee he had drunk had given him a false
strength. Now that the crisis was over he was
suddenly weak and tired&mdash;so tired. As he sat in
the corner, he thought over the events of the past
week. Always his thoughts came back to his
captain, that great, rough, rude commander.
Real kindness, Roy understood for the first time,
does not always consist in soft words or an easy
manner. He realized that now from his own experience.
He had been kind to the limit of kindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
to the woman he had rescued. But he had
treated her with violent roughness. He saw his
commander in a new light. Pondering over the
matter, he fell asleep. And for hours, huddled
in his corner, he was like one dead.</p>

<p>Morning came. Roy awoke. He was entirely
refreshed. He jumped to his feet, confused
at first. He did not know where he was.
Then the whole terrible situation came to him.
He supposed his companions were dead. He
tried to shut the memory of his terrible experience
out of his mind but could not. The suffering
about him weighed him down, sickened him. He
could stand danger better than distress. He
went outside and looked about.</p>

<p>The sight that greeted him was appalling.
The North Beach district, where he had so lately
battled with death between the houses, was a
surging sea. Three great structures still stood
with the waves beating about them. A passer-by
told him they were a private residence, the old
North Beach Hotel, and the Spohn Sanitarium.
Twenty-four hours earlier fifteen hundred houses
had stood where now Roy saw only tossing waves.
He turned from the sight in horror. The three
buildings that remained on North Beach were
terribly battered. Porticoes, doors, shutters,
chimneys, and other parts had been wrenched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
away by wave and wind. Whole wings had been
torn from the sanitarium. As Roy looked at it,
he saw with horror that there were people still in
it&mdash;doubtless sick and helpless.</p>

<p>Even as he looked Roy saw a man wading out
toward the hospital. He watched, fascinated.
Now swimming, now wading, the man fought his
way to the battered building. A white-robed
nurse appeared in a doorway. Presently the
man faced about and fought his way back to land.</p>

<p>Roy turned back into the church. “Who is
in charge here?” he asked one of the Red Cross
workers.</p>

<p>“Miss Mildred Seaton,” was the reply. “She
is over there, talking to that messenger from
Mayor Boone’s office.”</p>

<p>Roy made his way toward the two. “Miss
Seaton,” he said, when she had finished her talk
with the mayor’s messenger, “I want to know
what I can do to help.”</p>

<p>“What is your name? What can you do?
We need workers of all sorts.”</p>

<p>“I am Roy Mercer,” began Roy, “wireless
man on the steamship <em>Lycoming</em>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His companion cut him short. “What we
need more than anything else,” she said, “is
help. All the wires are down and we can get no
word out. Can you send a message?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is there a wireless station here?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do you know of any amateur operators? I
might be able to use their equipment.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know of any. Go to the mayor.”</p>

<p>She called to the messenger, who was just leaving
the room. “This is Mr. Mercer,” she said.
“Will you please take him directly to Mayor
Boone. He is a wireless operator. Perhaps he
can get help for us.”</p>

<p>The messenger took Roy directly to the mayor,
and introduced him.</p>

<p>“I suppose there are some amateur operators
in Corpus Christi,” said the mayor, “but I do not
know of any. However, there is a shop where all
sorts of electrical equipment are for sale. Maybe
you could find what you need there.” He told
Roy what he should say if he got into communication
with anybody.</p>

<p>Then he turned to his messenger. “Go with
this gentleman,” he said. “Spare no effort to
get what he needs. Lack of communication is
our worst trouble now.”</p>

<p>They found the owner of the shop. He had
the necessary equipment if it could be gotten, but
his store was under three feet of water.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to wade,” he said, “but we’ll take
a look.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>They reached the store and crawled in through
a broken show-window. They had no difficulty
to find wire, although it was on the floor. Only
after a long search under the muddy waters did
they secure a condenser. Neither wire nor condenser
was any the worse for the wetting. From
drawers and shelves, some awash and some high
and dry, they took one article after another&mdash;receivers,
a tuning coil, insulators, some large
batteries. But they could find no spark-gap.</p>

<p>“Have you a repair-shop?” asked Roy.
“And are there tools and materials in it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s right back of the shop, and it is
flooded, too.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” said Roy. “I’m used to
water by this time.”</p>

<p>They waded into the shop. The water was
about two inches below the level of the workbench.</p>

<p>“Good!” said Roy. “This will do fine!”</p>

<p>Skilfully he cut a block for the base, sawed
some pieces for posts, and drilled them and fastened
them upright at the proper distances from
one another. He got a short, slender metal rod,
cut it in half, ground the ends into sharp points
and thrust them into his uprights. It was a very
crude affair, but when properly wired up would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
work. The difficulty now was to get a key.
None was to be found. They gathered up all the
tools, wires and other things they would need,
and left the shop. At the railway station the
mayor’s messenger secured a telegraph-key.
Roy said that he could alter it a trifle so that it
would answer. Then, soaked but satisfied, they
carried their materials to the very highest part of
the city.</p>

<p>There Roy was made welcome in a private residence.
Rapidly he fashioned an aerial. With
the help of the owner of the house he suspended
this aerial between a high tree near by and a
chimney of the residence. He brought his lead-in
wire through a window, rapidly wired up his instruments,
and coupled on his batteries. As he
pressed his key, a fat spark leaped between the
points of his spark-gap. Skilfully he adjusted
these and turned to his host.</p>

<p>“If only I had a wireless signal book,” he
sighed. “It may be hard to raise anybody, for I
don’t know a single local call. Probably I’ll have
to send out an SOS. What is the nearest place
where they would be likely to have a Marconi station?”</p>

<p>“Probably San Antonio.”</p>

<p>“How far is that in a straight line?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly. Perhaps a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and twenty-five miles&mdash;possibly a hundred and
thirty.”</p>

<p>Roy looked at his batteries dubiously. “I’ll
make the effort anyway,” he said. “Maybe
they’ll carry that distance.”</p>

<p>“I hope you can get them,” said Roy’s host
anxiously. “We need help badly. We especially
need soldiers. Looting has begun.”</p>

<p>“Soldiers!” cried Roy. “Why didn’t I think
of them before? There’s an army post at
Brownsville. How far is that?”</p>

<p>“About the same distance as San Antonio.”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven I know their call signal,” cried
Roy.</p>

<p>He pressed his finger to his key. Blue sparks
leaped across his spark-gap. “WUZ&mdash;WUZ&mdash;WUZ,”
he flashed.</p>

<p>Then he sat breathless and listened. Would
his battery carry far enough? There was no answering
signal.</p>

<p>“WUZ&mdash;WUZ&mdash;WUZ,” flashed out Roy.
Then once more he sat tense, listening.</p>

<p>Something crackled in his ear. “Who is calling
WUZ?”</p>

<p>“Corpus Christi,” flashed back Roy. “City
terribly damaged by tidal wave. Scores drowned.
Hundreds of houses washed away. Property
loss millions. Need food, medicines, workers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
soldiers. Looting has begun. For God’s sake
rush help. Gordon Boone, Mayor.”</p>

<p>“Who is this talking?” came the reply.
“Never heard of a wireless station at Corpus
Christi.”</p>

<p>“This is Roy Mercer, shipwrecked wireless
man, talking on emergency outfit for city authorities.
Call ABC.”</p>

<p>So Roy sent abroad the news of the city’s
plight, even as Paul Revere carried to every Middlesex
village and farm the news of Lexington’s
peril. Next morning soldiers marched into the
city. Martial law was declared. Sentries were
posted. Corpus Christi was safe. Other helpers
rushed to the stricken community. A Red Cross
relief train sped to the rescue. The Salvation
Army sent workers. Physicians and nurses
came. Food and supplies poured in. The
stunned city pulled itself together. Workers
were organized to search out and care for the
dead, to clear the streets, to look after the homeless,
to feed the hungry. Emergency tent camps
arose. Canteens were opened. Boy scouts collected
clothes, carried messages, and were the legs
of the rescue work. And until telephonic communication
was restored, Roy sat at his instrument
hour after hour, sending and receiving messages
for the stricken city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>The air and the sea brought help. An army
aviator dropped thirty pounds of sorely needed
yeast into the city. The flood had spoiled all existing
stocks. As soon as the sea subsided, boats
rushed to Corpus Christi, bearing gifts. The sea-going
tug <em>Rotarian</em> came from Galveston, carrying
money, supplies, and workers.</p>

<p>When Roy learned of the <em>Rotarian’s</em> arrival he
sought her out and went aboard. The captain
met him as he came up the gangplank.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me anything about the <em>Lycoming</em>
or the <em>Empress</em>?” demanded Roy.</p>

<p>“Both safe in Galveston,” said the tug’s skipper.
“They are pretty badly battered up, but
still sound. They had an awful fight to make it.
The <em>Empress</em> broke her rudder and the <em>Lycoming</em>
took her in tow. Nobody but John Lansford
could have done it. I tell you he’s a wonder&mdash;heart
like a woman’s&mdash;courage like a grizzly&mdash;rough
as barnacles on a ship’s bottom. The
worst storm that ever blew&mdash;and I guess this was
it&mdash;couldn’t make him desert a ship in trouble.
He was darn near to port, he was, and didn’t he
turn back into the hurricane and take the <em>Empress</em>
in tow. Saved her, too. Put an oil slick
down, got lines aboard of her, and had her turn
her engines just enough to give her headway.
His lines would have parted in a minute if he’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
had to pull her whole weight. Oh! He’s a wonder
all right. It was a great rescue&mdash;great!”</p>

<p>“Was&mdash;was anybody lost?” asked Roy, hesitating.</p>

<p>“Small boat’s crew, including the third mate
and the wireless man.”</p>

<p>“And nothing has been heard from them?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely nothing.”</p>

<p>“I am the wireless man,” said Roy quietly.</p>

<p>“The deuce you are!” exclaimed the <em>Rotarian’s</em>
captain. “The deuce you are! Put her
there,” and he shook Roy’s hand warmly for a full
minute. “I’m mighty glad you pulled through.
They say you did great work.”</p>

<p>Roy’s heart leaped with joy. At last recognition
had come to him. His captain had changed
his mind about him. But to the tug’s captain he
said simply, “I’m glad to hear about the two
steamers. I wish we could get as good news of
the third mate and the others in the life-boat.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they here with you?”</p>

<p>Roy told him how they had been lost. Then
he added, “Will you take me back to Galveston
with you?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know,” exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>So it happened that when the <em>Rotarian</em>, a few
days later, tied up at her pier in Galveston, Roy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Mercer was the first person ashore. A single
glance told him that Galveston was unharmed.
The captain had already told him, however, how
the sea-wall had saved the city. Roy raced down
the pier and up the gangplank to the <em>Lycoming</em>.
The first person he met was the third mate. Roy
stopped dead in astonishment, then sprang forward
and grasped the mate’s hand.</p>

<p>“How did you get here?” he cried in astonishment.</p>

<p>The mate told him that after he, Roy, was
washed away from the others on the overturned
boat, the life-boat was driven straight toward the
highest point on Mustang Island. A few sand-dunes
remained above the flood, and on these the
crew found refuge. Two of the sailors died from
exposure, for they had to stay on their tiny
refuge, exposed to wind and rain, for fully forty-eight
hours. Then they got across Aransas Pass,
found food and shelter, and later made their way
along the railroad to San Patricio, where they
got a train back to Galveston. Barring the
sailors who died, all were back on the <em>Lycoming</em>
safe and sound.</p>

<p>Roy pressed on to the captain’s quarters.
He was very eager to see him. He felt sure
that this time a warm welcome awaited him. He
rapped on the captain’s door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come in,” said a rough voice.</p>

<p>Roy entered and stood before his commander.
“I report for duty again, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>The captain took his outstretched hand. “I’m
glad you escaped,” he said, “but you had no
business in that small boat. Your post of duty
was in the wireless house. You left me in great
difficulties. There was no way to communicate
quickly with the <em>Empress</em>. But I’m very glad
you escaped.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">VICTORY</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Poor Roy! He had come back expecting a
warm welcome from the captain and had
been greeted with a reprimand. He backed out
of the captain’s room, and hot tears welled to his
eyes despite his effort to suppress them. He believed
that he had come to understand his captain.
He believed that his roughness was but a mask
for a great heart. But it was evident he was
wrong. The captain had no heart. The captain
cared nothing for him. The captain still refused
to change his mind about wireless. And that
meant that when the ship got back to New York
Roy would pack his bag and say farewell to her
forever. He had done his best to win recognition
and failed. His errors were those of ignorance
and inexperience, not wilful wrongs. He
had tried so hard to help save the <em>Empress</em>. Now
he was reprimanded for what he had done.</p>

<p>Suddenly a new thought came into Roy’s mind.
“He said that I left him in difficulties. He said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
that I left him in difficulties,” repeated Roy to
himself. “That means that I was useful to him
and that he missed my help. I see that it was
wrong to leave my post. Others could row the
boat, but no one else could send wireless messages.
But since the two ships are safe, I’m glad
I went. I’m glad something made the old
dragon realize that wireless is worth something.”</p>

<p>The purser and the first mate greeted Roy so
warmly that it made him forget his disappointment
at the captain’s cold reception. In Mr.
Robbins and Mr. Young, at least, he had two
firm friends. So long as he lived, he would never
forget them.</p>

<p>He went to his room and took off his torn and
stained uniform. “I ought to get another,” he
muttered, “but I won’t. After I reach New
York I’ll probably never need a uniform.”</p>

<p>He dressed himself in the old suit he had worn
the day he came to New York. That was only
three months previously, but Roy had seen so
much and gone through so much that it seemed
like ages. What Roy did not appreciate was how
he had grown during those three months&mdash;not in
body, but in mind and character. The stern discipline
of his captain had held him so rigidly to
his duty that it had become second nature to do
his duty. He had developed those very qualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
that his captain most desired in his subordinates,
but apparently could not see in Roy.</p>

<p>After a while Roy went down on the lower
deck, where he heard the sound of hammers and
saws. Rails had been carried away, bulwarks
smashed, and many minor injuries done to the
ship. But these could be readily repaired and
carpenters were working busily to remedy the
trouble. Meantime, the cargo was shooting into
the hold as fast as ever. When he had fully inspected
the <em>Lycoming</em>, Roy went over to the <em>Empress</em>.
She was battered pretty badly. Roy
went aboard and made the acquaintance of Stimson,
the wireless man. The latter greeted him
with the utmost cordiality and introduced him to
the ship’s officers, from the captain down. All
expressed their gratitude to Roy for the part he
had had in their rescue. So Roy went back to
the <em>Lycoming</em> much happier in mind than he had
been when he left her.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later the <em>Lycoming</em>
steamed out of the harbor. Five days later still
she lay at her dock in New York. It was Roy’s
last day aboard of her, he supposed, and he was
depressed and sick at heart. He had become
fond of the ship and her crew. He had even
come to love his commander, though not in the
way he loved the purser. Just now he felt very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
hard toward Captain Lansford. He expected
the new wireless man would come aboard in a few
hours. Before he came, Roy wished to say good-bye
to his friends, so that he could leave promptly.
He started for the purser’s office. On the way,
he passed a young man who inquired for the captain.
Roy directed him to the captain’s quarters,
then turned away. He heard the door open and
the man say, “Captain Lansford, I’m the new
wireless man. The Marconi people instructed
me to report to you for duty.”</p>

<p>“New wireless man!” Roy heard the captain
roar, and though he did not mean to eavesdrop,
he stood as though rooted to the deck. “New
wireless man!” cried the captain. “What do
I want of a new wireless man? I’ve got the best
wireless man afloat. Go back and tell ’em so.”</p>

<p>“But I understood that you wanted to make
a change&mdash;that your present operator is too
young.”</p>

<p>“You did, eh? Well, he is a bit young, but I
can trust him absolutely. And he’s got more
brains than your whole outfit put together. It’ll
be a cold day when I go to sea without him.
Good-day, sir.”</p>

<p>The surprised Marconi man turned about and
made for the pier. Roy fled to the wireless house.
His heart was beating wildly. His whole soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
was singing. He had made good. The captain
wanted him to stay. The captain did like him,
despite his rough manner. His jubilation was so
great he could hardly sit still.</p>

<p>Presently his brow puckered. How was he to
get the captain to tell him that he was to stay?
An idea came to Roy. He jumped to his feet
and ran down to the captain’s cabin.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said a gruff voice, in answer to his
knock.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to say good-bye, sir,” said Roy.
“You know my three months are up. I am
sorry, sir, for I should like to stay on the <em>Lycoming</em>.
Good-bye, sir.”</p>

<p>The captain jumped to his feet. “Who told
you to leave the ship?” he roared.</p>

<p>“No one now, sir, but when I came aboard you
said I was to stay three months. The time is up.
I supposed you wanted me to leave.”</p>

<p>“I don’t. That is, if I’ve got to have a wireless
man aboard you might as well stay. I don’t
want to have to break another one in. You are
not relieved from duty. Go to your quarters,
sir.”</p>

<p>Roy went back to the wireless house. The
captain’s gruff words could not still the song that
his heart was singing. He had won. He had
made good. His captain liked him, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
loved him&mdash;in his strange way. He thanked his
lucky stars that he had been an eavesdropper.
Now he knew the truth about the captain. The
skipper of the <em>Rotarian</em> had told the truth. The
rough manner was only a mask to cover a great
heart. All Roy’s pent-up affection went out to
this commander. He understood him now.
Like the first mate and the purser, he felt a genuine
affection for his captain. It had taken a long
time to see beneath the surface, but nothing could
now blind his eyes. He understood his commander.
And, best of all, he had made good.</p>

<p>“Well,” he sighed joyfully, “I guess I’ll need
a new uniform after all.”</p>

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
